Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
              Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very
              extensible interface.
We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:
If you use require for importing, only default export is available:
For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:
Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):

Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in AngularJS. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of AngularJS.

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by configuring dev container files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.
GitHub Codespaces run on a variety of VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. You can connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.
There are a number of entry points to spin up a Codespaces environment. These include:
Learn more about how to use Codespaces in our documentation.
GitHub Codespaces is available for developers in every organization. All personal GitHub.com accounts include a monthly quota of free usage each month. GitHub will provide users in the Free plan 120 core hours, or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month. You can see how the remaining balance on the billing page.
Codespaces is available for teams and companies, but needs to be enabled first in an organization’s settings. Teams and companies are able to select which repositories and users have access to Codespaces for added security and permissioning control. You can find information on how to enable Codespaces in an organization in our docs.
Codespaces is available for free for individual use for up to 60 hours a month and comes with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing afterwards. For organizations, Codespaces is available with pay-as-you-go pricing and has pricing controls so any company or team can determine how much they want to spend a month.

On GitHub, lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.




            See what’s possible
          


      Pull requests are fundamental to how teams review and improve code on GitHub. Evolve projects, propose new features, and discuss implementation details before changing your source code.
    

      Start a new feature or propose a change to existing code with a pull request—a base for your team to coordinate details and refine your changes.
    


    Learn pull request fundementals 



          Preview changes in context with your code to see what is being proposed. Side-by-side Diffs highlight added, edited, and deleted code right next to the original file, so you can easily spot changes.
        


    Learn how to compare branches with diffs 



          Browse commits, comments, and references related to your pull request in a timeline-style interface. Your pull request will also highlight what’s changed since you last checked.
        

Pro-tip: You can search your commit history by keyword, committer, organization, and more.
        

          See what a file looked like before a particular change. With blame view, you can see how any portion of your file has evolved over time without viewing the file’s full history.
        

Pro-tip: Use  git blame  to trace the changes in a file.
        

          On GitHub, conversations happen alongside your code. Leave detailed comments on code syntax and ask questions about structure inline.
        

          If you’re on the other side of the code, requesting peer reviews is easy. Add users to your pull request, and they’ll receive a notification letting them know you need their feedback.
        

          Save your teammates a few notifications. Bundle your comments into one cohesive review, then specify whether comments are required changes or just suggestions.
        

      You can’t always avoid conflict. Merge pull requests faster by resolving simple merge conflicts on GitHub—no command line necessary.
    

      Learn how to resolve merge conflicts on GitHub and using the command line.
    

      Reviews can improve your code, but mistakes happen. Limit human error and ensure only high quality code gets merged with detailed permissions and status checks.
    

          Give collaborators as much access as they need through your repository settings. You can extend access to a few teams and select which ones can read or write to your files. The options you have for permissions depend on your plan.
        


    See plan options 



Protected Branches help you maintain the integrity of your code. Limit who can push to a branch, and disable force pushes to specific branches. Then scale your policies with the Protected Branches API.
        

          Create required status checks to add an extra layer of error prevention on branches. Use the Status API to enforce checks and disable the merge button until they pass. To err is human; to automate, divine!
        

      Build on GitHub with review tools to avoid human error and add extra polish to your team’s code with review tools.

Create issues, break them into tasks, track relationships, add custom fields, and have conversations. Visualize large projects as tables, boards, or roadmaps, and automate everything with code.
Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live workspace to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. Tailor them to your needs with custom fields and saved views, then visualize your project with roadmaps.
Tackle complex issues with task lists and track their status with new progress indicators. Convert tasks into their own issues and navigate your work hierarchy.
Express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, mention contributors, react with emoji, clarify with attachments, and see references from commits, pull requests, releases, and deploys. Coordinate by assigning contributors and teams, or by adding them to milestones and projects. All in a single timeline.
The latest report from our testers is in and our sprite animations are a little off. Good news is not by much, so we should be able to squeeze this into our current sprint.
We just published the report—see octoarcade/testers#323 👉
Thanks @keisaacson! Here’s a video walkthrough showing the proposed changes.
Save views for sprints, backlogs, teams, or releases. Rank, group, sort, slice and filter to suit the occasion. Create swimlanes, share templates and set work in progress limits.
No mouse? No problem. Every action you can take with the mouse has a keyboard shortcut or command. Filter, sort, group, and assign issues. Your hands never leave the keyboard.
Track metadata like iterations, priority, story points, dates, notes, and links. Add custom fields to projects and edit from the issue sidebar.



 Now with iteration cycle planning
      
Track the health of your current iteration cycle, milestone, or any other custom field you create with new project insights. Identify bottlenecks and issues blocking the team from making progress with the new burn up chart.
Create templates to share and reuse when getting started with a new project. Share inspiration across teams and get started with a single click.
Accelerate your project planning with workflows. Automatically triage issues, set values for custom fields, and auto add or archive issues.
Issues can be viewed, created, and managed in your browser, your favorite terminal, or on your phone or tablet.
View, update, and create issues without ever leaving your terminal.
Create and manage issues on the go with our native iOS and Android mobile apps.
We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.
With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.
We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.
As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.
The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.
Yes. You can migrate your existing Projects (classic) to the new GitHub Projects through a new feature preview.
How it works:
All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.
Historical charts are available for all Enterprise organizations and are currently in Preview for organizations on Team plans.**
**Subject to change as we add future capabilities.

Hello fellow octoinvaders! I want to brainstorm new ideas for power-ups. What's the Mona equivalent to coin boxes and mushrooms?
Echoing what @pifafu said, I’d love to see Hubot show up as the sidekick delivering the power-ups. He'd give Mona superpowers similar to how GitHub products give developers superpowers. Here is a potential list based on the current features:
Thread conversations. Keep context in-tact and conversations on track with threaded comments.
A power-up could be calling Hubot and they would magically reveal the path and protect Mona for a set period of time.
What if Hubot was some sort of provider of power-up and gave different types of power/objects depending on levels?
I like the collaboration idea, perfect fit for the characters.
What about a jetpack to make Mona 10x faster for 10s.
Magic portals could be sweet and add some randomness.
In the same vein, a merge tool could be a cool hint.
Ask your community with polls. Gauge interest in a feature, vote on a meetup time, or learn more about your community with custom polls.
I got a bunch of really cool ideas from y’all about how Hubot will help Mona in her quest. Now we need to choose the one we’ll implement in the game. Pick your favorite!

Using npm:
Using bower:
Using yarn:
Using pnpm:
Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:
If you use require for importing, only default export is available:
For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:
Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):
Using unpkg CDN:
Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in AngularJS. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of AngularJS.

If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in AngularJS. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of AngularJS.

Using npm:
Using bower:
Using yarn:
Using pnpm:
Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:
If you use require for importing, only default export is available:
For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:
Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):
Using unpkg CDN:
Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:

axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:
If you use require for importing, only default export is available:
For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:

Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.

Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in AngularJS. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of AngularJS.

Using npm:
Using bower:
Using yarn:
Using pnpm:
Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:
If you use require for importing, only default export is available:
For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:
Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):
Using unpkg CDN:
Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.

Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept

Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:

In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,

If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in AngularJS. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of AngularJS.

Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.

Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using import or require approach:
You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:
If you use require for importing, only default export is available:
For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:
Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):
Using unpkg CDN:
Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,

Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):
Using unpkg CDN:
Note: CommonJS usage
In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with require(), use the following approach:
Note: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
Performing a POST request
Performing multiple concurrent requests
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Please use Promise.all to replace the below functions.
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.
If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return
of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.
Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
Read the interceptor tests for seeing all this in code.
There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.
The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
Below is a list of potential axios identified error
the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.
Using the validateStatus config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancellable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.
If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use the URLSearchParams API, which is supported in the vast majority of browsers,and  Node starting with v10 (released in 2018).
For compatibility with very old browsers, there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
For older Node.js engines, you can use the querystring module as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case.
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
The server will handle it as:
If your backend body-parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically
To send the data as a multipart/formdata you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.
Setting the Content-Type header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.
In node.js, you can use the form-data library as follows:
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request Content-Type
header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
In the node.js build, the (form-data) polyfill is used by default.
You can overload the FormData class by setting the env.FormData config variable,
but you probably won't need it in most cases:
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
Note: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the Content-Type header preset to multipart/form-data.
You can easily submit a single file:
or multiple files as multipart/form-data:
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[].
Pass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as multipart/form-data content.
FormData and HTMLForm objects can also be posted as JSON by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to application/json:
For example, the Form
will be submitted as the following JSON object:
Sending Blobs/Files as JSON (base64) is not currently supported.
Axios supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.
You can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:
Note:
Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.
⚠️ Warning
It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the node.js environment,
as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the "backpressure" algorithm.
Download and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):
Axios has its own AxiosHeaders class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.
Although HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons
and for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.
The old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.
An AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.
The final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the toJSON method.
Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.
The header value can be one of the following types:
Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.
The headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:
You can iterate over an AxiosHeaders instance using a for...of statement:
Constructs a new AxiosHeaders instance.
If the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
The rewrite argument controls the overwriting behavior:
The option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.
Returns this.
Returns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with RegExp.exec,
matcher function or internal key-value parser.
Returns the value of the header.
Returns true if the header is set (has no undefined value).
Returns true if at least one header has been removed.
Removes all headers.
Unlike the delete method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.
Returns true if at least one header has been cleared.
If the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.
This method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.
Axios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.
Set format to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (cOntEnt-type => Content-Type)
Returns this.
Merges the instance with targets into a new AxiosHeaders instance. If the target is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance.
Resolve all internal headers values into a new null prototype object.
Set asStrings to true to resolve arrays as a string containing all elements, separated by commas.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created from the raw headers passed in,
or simply returns the given headers object if it's an AxiosHeaders instance.
Returns a new AxiosHeaders instance created by merging the target objects.
The following shortcuts are available:
setContentType, getContentType, hasContentType
setContentLength, getContentLength, hasContentLength
setAccept, getAccept, hasAccept
setUserAgent, getUserAgent, hasUserAgent
setContentEncoding, getContentEncoding, hasContentEncoding
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions and a type guard for axios errors.
Because axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS module.exports, there are some caveats.
The recommended setting is to use "moduleResolution": "node16" (this is implied by "module": "node16"). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.
If use ESM, your settings should be fine.
If you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can’t use "moduleResolution": "node 16", you have to enable esModuleInterop.
If you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use "moduleResolution": "node16".
You can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.

axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in AngularJS. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of AngularJS.

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.
Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.
If your communication needs to involve receiving event data or message data from a server, consider using server-sent events through the EventSource interface. For full-duplex communication, WebSockets may be a better choice.
Note: This feature is available in Web Workers, except for Service Workers
The constructor initializes an XMLHttpRequest. It must be called before any other method calls.
This interface also inherits properties of XMLHttpRequestEventTarget and of EventTarget.
Returns a number representing the state of the request.
Returns an ArrayBuffer, a Blob, a Document, a JavaScript object, or a string, depending on the value of XMLHttpRequest.responseType, that contains the response entity body.
Returns a string that contains the response to the request as text, or null if the request was unsuccessful or has not yet been sent.
Specifies the type of the response.
Returns the serialized URL of the response or the empty string if the URL is null.
Returns a Document containing the response to the request, or null if the request was unsuccessful, has not yet been sent, or cannot be parsed as XML or HTML. Not available in Web Workers.
Returns the HTTP response status code of the request.
Returns a string containing the response string returned by the HTTP server. Unlike XMLHttpRequest.status, this includes the entire text of the response message ("OK", for example).
Note: According to the HTTP/2 specification RFC 7540, section 8.1.2.4: Response Pseudo-Header Fields, HTTP/2 does not define a way to carry the version or reason phrase that is included in an HTTP/1.1 status line.
The time in milliseconds a request can take before automatically being terminated.
A XMLHttpRequestUpload representing the upload process.
Returns true if cross-site Access-Control requests should be made using credentials such as cookies or authorization headers; otherwise false.
The channel used by the object when performing the request.
A boolean. If true, the request will be sent without cookie and authentication headers.
A boolean. If true, the same origin policy will not be enforced on the request.
A boolean. It indicates whether or not the object represents a background service request.
Aborts the request if it has already been sent.
Returns all the response headers, separated by CRLF, as a string, or null if no response has been received.
Returns the string containing the text of the specified header, or null if either the response has not yet been received or the header doesn't exist in the response.
Initializes a request.
Overrides the MIME type returned by the server.
Sends the request. If the request is asynchronous (which is the default), this method returns as soon as the request is sent.
Sets the value of an HTTP request header. You must call setRequestHeader() after open(), but before send().

      Fired when a request has been aborted, for example because the program called XMLHttpRequest.abort().
      Also available via the onabort event handler property.
    

      Fired when the request encountered an error.
      Also available via the onerror event handler property.
    

      Fired when an XMLHttpRequest transaction completes successfully.
      Also available via the onload event handler property.
    

      Fired when a request has completed, whether successfully (after load) or unsuccessfully (after abort or error).
      Also available via the onloadend event handler property.
    

      Fired when a request has started to load data.
      Also available via the onloadstart event handler property.
    

      Fired periodically when a request receives more data.
      Also available via the onprogress event handler property.
    

      Fired whenever the readyState property changes.
      Also available via the onreadystatechange event handler property.

Source Code: lib/http.js
To use the HTTP server and client one must require('node:http').
The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features
of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use.
In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is
careful to never buffer entire requests or responses, so the
user is able to stream data.
HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:
Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified.
In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js
HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message
parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not
parse the actual headers or the body.
See message.headers for details on how duplicate headers are handled.
The raw headers as they were received are retained in the rawHeaders
property, which is an array of [key, value, key2, value2, ...]. For
example, the previous message header object might have a rawHeaders
list like the following:
An Agent is responsible for managing connection persistence
and reuse for HTTP clients. It maintains a queue of pending requests
for a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each
until the queue is empty, at which time the socket is either destroyed
or put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the
same host and port. Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the
keepAlive option.
Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may
still close idle connections, in which case they will be removed from the
pool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for
that host and port. Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests
over the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be
remade for every request and cannot be pooled. The Agent will still make
the requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.
When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed
from the pool. Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not
to keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.
(see socket.unref()).
It is good practice, to destroy() an Agent instance when it is no
longer in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.
Sockets are removed from an agent when the socket emits either
a 'close' event or an 'agentRemove' event. When intending to keep one
HTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the agent, something
like the following may be done:
An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing
{agent: false} as an option to the http.get() or http.request()
functions, a one-time use Agent with default options will be used
for the client connection.
agent:false:
Change the default scheduling from 'fifo' to 'lifo'.
Add scheduling option to specify the free socket scheduling strategy.
Add maxTotalSockets option to agent constructor.
Added in: v0.3.4
options in socket.connect() are also supported.
The default http.globalAgent that is used by http.request() has all
of these values set to their respective defaults.
To configure any of them, a custom http.Agent instance must be created.
Produces a socket/stream to be used for HTTP requests.
By default, this function is the same as net.createConnection(). However,
custom agents may override this method in case greater flexibility is desired.
A socket/stream can be supplied in one of two ways: by returning the
socket/stream from this function, or by passing the socket/stream to callback.
This method is guaranteed to return an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
callback has a signature of (err, stream).
Called when socket is detached from a request and could be persisted by the
Agent. Default behavior is to:
This method can be overridden by a particular Agent subclass. If this
method returns a falsy value, the socket will be destroyed instead of persisting
it for use with the next request.
The socket argument can be an instance of <net.Socket>, a subclass of
<stream.Duplex>.
Called when socket is attached to request after being persisted because of
the keep-alive options. Default behavior is to:
This method can be overridden by a particular Agent subclass.
The socket argument can be an instance of <net.Socket>, a subclass of
<stream.Duplex>.
Destroy any sockets that are currently in use by the agent.
It is usually not necessary to do this. However, if using an
agent with keepAlive enabled, then it is best to explicitly shut down
the agent when it is no longer needed. Otherwise,
sockets might stay open for quite a long time before the server
terminates them.
The property now has a null prototype.
Added in: v0.11.4
An object which contains arrays of sockets currently awaiting use by
the agent when keepAlive is enabled. Do not modify.
Sockets in the freeSockets list will be automatically destroyed and
removed from the array on 'timeout'.
The options parameter is now optional.
Added in: v0.11.4
Get a unique name for a set of request options, to determine whether a
connection can be reused. For an HTTP agent, this returns
host:port:localAddress or host:port:localAddress:family. For an HTTPS agent,
the name includes the CA, cert, ciphers, and other HTTPS/TLS-specific options
that determine socket reusability.
By default set to 256. For agents with keepAlive enabled, this
sets the maximum number of sockets that will be left open in the free
state.
By default set to Infinity. Determines how many concurrent sockets the agent
can have open per origin. Origin is the returned value of agent.getName().
By default set to Infinity. Determines how many concurrent sockets the agent
can have open. Unlike maxSockets, this parameter applies across all origins.
The property now has a null prototype.
Added in: v0.5.9
An object which contains queues of requests that have not yet been assigned to
sockets. Do not modify.
The property now has a null prototype.
Added in: v0.3.6
An object which contains arrays of sockets currently in use by the
agent. Do not modify.
This object is created internally and returned from http.request(). It
represents an in-progress request whose header has already been queued. The
header is still mutable using the setHeader(name, value),
getHeader(name), removeHeader(name) API. The actual header will
be sent along with the first data chunk or when calling request.end().
To get the response, add a listener for 'response' to the request object.
'response' will be emitted from the request object when the response
headers have been received. The 'response' event is executed with one
argument which is an instance of http.IncomingMessage.
During the 'response' event, one can add listeners to the
response object; particularly to listen for the 'data' event.
If no 'response' handler is added, then the response will be
entirely discarded. However, if a 'response' event handler is added,
then the data from the response object must be consumed, either by
calling response.read() whenever there is a 'readable' event, or
by adding a 'data' handler, or by calling the .resume() method.
Until the data is consumed, the 'end' event will not fire. Also, until
the data is read it will consume memory that can eventually lead to a
'process out of memory' error.
For backward compatibility, res will only emit 'error' if there is an
'error' listener registered.
Set Content-Length header to limit the response body size.
If response.strictContentLength is set to true, mismatching the
Content-Length header value will result in an Error being thrown,
identified by code: 'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'.
Content-Length value should be in bytes, not characters. Use
Buffer.byteLength() to determine the length of the body in bytes.


Emitted when the request has been aborted by the client. This event is only
emitted on the first call to abort().
Indicates that the request is completed, or its underlying connection was
terminated prematurely (before the response completion).
Emitted each time a server responds to a request with a CONNECT method. If
this event is not being listened for, clients receiving a CONNECT method will
have their connections closed.
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
A client and server pair demonstrating how to listen for the 'connect' event:
Emitted when the server sends a '100 Continue' HTTP response, usually because
the request contained 'Expect: 100-continue'. This is an instruction that
the client should send the request body.
Emitted when the request has been sent. More specifically, this event is emitted
when the last segment of the response headers and body have been handed off to
the operating system for transmission over the network. It does not imply that
the server has received anything yet.
Emitted when the server sends a 1xx intermediate response (excluding 101
Upgrade). The listeners of this event will receive an object containing the
HTTP version, status code, status message, key-value headers object,
and array with the raw header names followed by their respective values.
101 Upgrade statuses do not fire this event due to their break from the
traditional HTTP request/response chain, such as web sockets, in-place TLS
upgrades, or HTTP 2.0. To be notified of 101 Upgrade notices, listen for the
'upgrade' event instead.
Emitted when a response is received to this request. This event is emitted only
once.
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
Emitted when the underlying socket times out from inactivity. This only notifies
that the socket has been idle. The request must be destroyed manually.
See also: request.setTimeout().
Emitted each time a server responds to a request with an upgrade. If this
event is not being listened for and the response status code is 101 Switching
Protocols, clients receiving an upgrade header will have their connections
closed.
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
A client server pair demonstrating how to listen for the 'upgrade' event.


Marks the request as aborting. Calling this will cause remaining data
in the response to be dropped and the socket to be destroyed.
Deprecated since: v17.0.0, v16.12.0
The aborted property is no longer a timestamp number.
Added in: v0.11.14


The request.aborted property will be true if the request has
been aborted.


See request.socket.
See writable.cork().
The data parameter can now be a Uint8Array.
This method now returns a reference to ClientRequest.
Added in: v0.1.90
Finishes sending the request. If any parts of the body are
unsent, it will flush them to the stream. If the request is
chunked, this will send the terminating '0\r\n\r\n'.
If data is specified, it is equivalent to calling
request.write(data, encoding) followed by request.end(callback).
If callback is specified, it will be called when the request stream
is finished.
The function returns this for consistency with other Readable streams.
Added in: v0.3.0
Destroy the request. Optionally emit an 'error' event,
and emit a 'close' event. Calling this will cause remaining data
in the response to be dropped and the socket to be destroyed.
See writable.destroy() for further details.
Is true after request.destroy() has been called.
See writable.destroyed for further details.


The request.finished property will be true if request.end()
has been called. request.end() will automatically be called if the
request was initiated via http.get().
Flushes the request headers.
For efficiency reasons, Node.js normally buffers the request headers until
request.end() is called or the first chunk of request data is written. It
then tries to pack the request headers and data into a single TCP packet.
That's usually desired (it saves a TCP round-trip), but not when the first
data is not sent until possibly much later. request.flushHeaders() bypasses
the optimization and kickstarts the request.
Reads out a header on the request. The name is case-insensitive.
The type of the return value depends on the arguments provided to
request.setHeader().
Returns an array containing the unique names of the current outgoing headers.
All header names are lowercase.
Returns a shallow copy of the current outgoing headers. Since a shallow copy
is used, array values may be mutated without additional calls to various
header-related http module methods. The keys of the returned object are the
header names and the values are the respective header values. All header names
are lowercase.
The object returned by the request.getHeaders() method does not
prototypically inherit from the JavaScript Object. This means that typical
Object methods such as obj.toString(), obj.hasOwnProperty(), and others
are not defined and will not work.
Returns an array containing the unique names of the current outgoing raw
headers. Header names are returned with their exact casing being set.
Returns true if the header identified by name is currently set in the
outgoing headers. The header name matching is case-insensitive.
Limits maximum response headers count. If set to 0, no limit will be applied.
Removes a header that's already defined into headers object.
When sending request through a keep-alive enabled agent, the underlying socket
might be reused. But if server closes connection at unfortunate time, client
may run into a 'ECONNRESET' error.
By marking a request whether it reused socket or not, we can do
automatic error retry base on it.
Sets a single header value for headers object. If this header already exists in
the to-be-sent headers, its value will be replaced. Use an array of strings
here to send multiple headers with the same name. Non-string values will be
stored without modification. Therefore, request.getHeader() may return
non-string values. However, the non-string values will be converted to strings
for network transmission.
or
When the value is a string an exception will be thrown if it contains
characters outside the latin1 encoding.
If you need to pass UTF-8 characters in the value please encode the value
using the RFC 8187 standard.
Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected
socket.setNoDelay() will be called.
Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected
socket.setKeepAlive() will be called.
Consistently set socket timeout only when the socket connects.
Added in: v0.5.9
Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected
socket.setTimeout() will be called.
Reference to the underlying socket. Usually users will not want to access
this property. In particular, the socket will not emit 'readable' events
because of how the protocol parser attaches to the socket.
This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specified a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
See writable.uncork().
Is true after request.end() has been called. This property
does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use
request.writableFinished instead.
Is true if all data has been flushed to the underlying system, immediately
before the 'finish' event is emitted.
The chunk parameter can now be a Uint8Array.
Added in: v0.1.29
Sends a chunk of the body. This method can be called multiple times. If no
Content-Length is set, data will automatically be encoded in HTTP Chunked
transfer encoding, so that server knows when the data ends. The
Transfer-Encoding: chunked header is added. Calling request.end()
is necessary to finish sending the request.
The encoding argument is optional and only applies when chunk is a string.
Defaults to 'utf8'.
The callback argument is optional and will be called when this chunk of data
is flushed, but only if the chunk is non-empty.
Returns true if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel
buffer. Returns false if all or part of the data was queued in user memory.
'drain' will be emitted when the buffer is free again.
When write function is called with empty string or buffer, it does
nothing and waits for more input.
Emitted each time a request with an HTTP Expect: 100-continue is received.
If this event is not listened for, the server will automatically respond
with a 100 Continue as appropriate.
Handling this event involves calling response.writeContinue() if the
client should continue to send the request body, or generating an appropriate
HTTP response (e.g. 400 Bad Request) if the client should not continue to send
the request body.
When this event is emitted and handled, the 'request' event will
not be emitted.
Emitted each time a request with an HTTP Expect header is received, where the
value is not 100-continue. If this event is not listened for, the server will
automatically respond with a 417 Expectation Failed as appropriate.
When this event is emitted and handled, the 'request' event will
not be emitted.
The default behavior will return a 431 Request Header Fields Too Large if a HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW error occurs.
The rawPacket is the current buffer that just parsed. Adding this buffer to the error object of 'clientError' event is to make it possible that developers can log the broken packet.
The default action of calling .destroy() on the socket will no longer take place if there are listeners attached for 'clientError'.
Added in: v0.1.94
If a client connection emits an 'error' event, it will be forwarded here.
Listener of this event is responsible for closing/destroying the underlying
socket. For example, one may wish to more gracefully close the socket with a
custom HTTP response instead of abruptly severing the connection. The socket
must be closed or destroyed before the listener ends.
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
Default behavior is to try close the socket with a HTTP '400 Bad Request',
or a HTTP '431 Request Header Fields Too Large' in the case of a
HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW error. If the socket is not writable or headers
of the current attached http.ServerResponse has been sent, it is
immediately destroyed.
socket is the net.Socket object that the error originated from.
When the 'clientError' event occurs, there is no request or response
object, so any HTTP response sent, including response headers and payload,
must be written directly to the socket object. Care must be taken to
ensure the response is a properly formatted HTTP response message.
err is an instance of Error with two extra columns:
In some cases, the client has already received the response and/or the socket
has already been destroyed, like in case of ECONNRESET errors. Before
trying to send data to the socket, it is better to check that it is still
writable.
Emitted when the server closes.
Emitted each time a client requests an HTTP CONNECT method. If this event is
not listened for, then clients requesting a CONNECT method will have their
connections closed.
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
After this event is emitted, the request's socket will not have a 'data'
event listener, meaning it will need to be bound in order to handle data
sent to the server on that socket.
This event is emitted when a new TCP stream is established. socket is
typically an object of type net.Socket. Usually users will not want to
access this event. In particular, the socket will not emit 'readable' events
because of how the protocol parser attaches to the socket. The socket can
also be accessed at request.socket.
This event can also be explicitly emitted by users to inject connections
into the HTTP server. In that case, any Duplex stream can be passed.
If socket.setTimeout() is called here, the timeout will be replaced with
server.keepAliveTimeout when the socket has served a request (if
server.keepAliveTimeout is non-zero).
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
When the number of requests on a socket reaches the threshold of
server.maxRequestsPerSocket, the server will drop new requests
and emit 'dropRequest' event instead, then send 503 to client.
Emitted each time there is a request. There may be multiple requests
per connection (in the case of HTTP Keep-Alive connections).
Not listening to this event no longer causes the socket to be destroyed if a client sends an Upgrade header.
Added in: v0.1.94
Emitted each time a client requests an HTTP upgrade. Listening to this event
is optional and clients cannot insist on a protocol change.
After this event is emitted, the request's socket will not have a 'data'
event listener, meaning it will need to be bound in order to handle data
sent to the server on that socket.
This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
The method closes idle connections before returning.
Added in: v0.1.90
Stops the server from accepting new connections and closes all connections
connected to this server which are not sending a request or waiting for
a response.
See net.Server.close().
Closes all connections connected to this server.
Closes all connections connected to this server which are not sending a request
or waiting for a response.
The default is now set to the minimum between 60000 (60 seconds) or requestTimeout.
Added in: v11.3.0, v10.14.0
Limit the amount of time the parser will wait to receive the complete HTTP
headers.
If the timeout expires, the server responds with status 408 without
forwarding the request to the request listener and then closes the connection.
It must be set to a non-zero value (e.g. 120 seconds) to protect against
potential Denial-of-Service attacks in case the server is deployed without a
reverse proxy in front.
Starts the HTTP server listening for connections.
This method is identical to server.listen() from net.Server.
Limits maximum incoming headers count. If set to 0, no limit will be applied.
The default request timeout changed from no timeout to 300s (5 minutes).
Added in: v14.11.0
Sets the timeout value in milliseconds for receiving the entire request from
the client.
If the timeout expires, the server responds with status 408 without
forwarding the request to the request listener and then closes the connection.
It must be set to a non-zero value (e.g. 120 seconds) to protect against
potential Denial-of-Service attacks in case the server is deployed without a
reverse proxy in front.
The default timeout changed from 120s to 0 (no timeout).
Added in: v0.9.12
Sets the timeout value for sockets, and emits a 'timeout' event on
the Server object, passing the socket as an argument, if a timeout
occurs.
If there is a 'timeout' event listener on the Server object, then it
will be called with the timed-out socket as an argument.
By default, the Server does not timeout sockets. However, if a callback
is assigned to the Server's 'timeout' event, timeouts must be handled
explicitly.
The maximum number of requests socket can handle
before closing keep alive connection.
A value of 0 will disable the limit.
When the limit is reached it will set the Connection header value to close,
but will not actually close the connection, subsequent requests sent
after the limit is reached will get 503 Service Unavailable as a response.
The default timeout changed from 120s to 0 (no timeout).
Added in: v0.9.12
The number of milliseconds of inactivity before a socket is presumed
to have timed out.
A value of 0 will disable the timeout behavior on incoming connections.
The socket timeout logic is set up on connection, so changing this
value only affects new connections to the server, not any existing connections.
The number of milliseconds of inactivity a server needs to wait for additional
incoming data, after it has finished writing the last response, before a socket
will be destroyed. If the server receives new data before the keep-alive
timeout has fired, it will reset the regular inactivity timeout, i.e.,
server.timeout.
A value of 0 will disable the keep-alive timeout behavior on incoming
connections.
A value of 0 makes the http server behave similarly to Node.js versions prior
to 8.0.0, which did not have a keep-alive timeout.
The socket timeout logic is set up on connection, so changing this value only
affects new connections to the server, not any existing connections.


Calls server.close() and returns a promise that fulfills when the
server has closed.
This object is created internally by an HTTP server, not by the user. It is
passed as the second parameter to the 'request' event.
Indicates that the response is completed, or its underlying connection was
terminated prematurely (before the response completion).
Emitted when the response has been sent. More specifically, this event is
emitted when the last segment of the response headers and body have been
handed off to the operating system for transmission over the network. It
does not imply that the client has received anything yet.
This method adds HTTP trailing headers (a header but at the end of the
message) to the response.
Trailers will only be emitted if chunked encoding is used for the
response; if it is not (e.g. if the request was HTTP/1.0), they will
be silently discarded.
HTTP requires the Trailer header to be sent in order to
emit trailers, with a list of the header fields in its value. E.g.,
Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a TypeError being thrown.


See response.socket.
See writable.cork().
The data parameter can now be a Uint8Array.
This method now returns a reference to ServerResponse.
Added in: v0.1.90
This method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body
have been sent; that server should consider this message complete.
The method, response.end(), MUST be called on each response.
If data is specified, it is similar in effect to calling
response.write(data, encoding) followed by response.end(callback).
If callback is specified, it will be called when the response stream
is finished.


The response.finished property will be true if response.end()
has been called.
Flushes the response headers. See also: request.flushHeaders().
Reads out a header that's already been queued but not sent to the client.
The name is case-insensitive. The type of the return value depends
on the arguments provided to response.setHeader().
Returns an array containing the unique names of the current outgoing headers.
All header names are lowercase.
Returns a shallow copy of the current outgoing headers. Since a shallow copy
is used, array values may be mutated without additional calls to various
header-related http module methods. The keys of the returned object are the
header names and the values are the respective header values. All header names
are lowercase.
The object returned by the response.getHeaders() method does not
prototypically inherit from the JavaScript Object. This means that typical
Object methods such as obj.toString(), obj.hasOwnProperty(), and others
are not defined and will not work.
Returns true if the header identified by name is currently set in the
outgoing headers. The header name matching is case-insensitive.
Boolean (read-only). True if headers were sent, false otherwise.
Removes a header that's queued for implicit sending.
A reference to the original HTTP request object.
When true, the Date header will be automatically generated and sent in
the response if it is not already present in the headers. Defaults to true.
This should only be disabled for testing; HTTP requires the Date header
in responses.
Returns the response object.
Sets a single header value for implicit headers. If this header already exists
in the to-be-sent headers, its value will be replaced. Use an array of strings
here to send multiple headers with the same name. Non-string values will be
stored without modification. Therefore, response.getHeader() may return
non-string values. However, the non-string values will be converted to strings
for network transmission. The same response object is returned to the caller,
to enable call chaining.
or
Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a TypeError being thrown.
When headers have been set with response.setHeader(), they will be merged
with any headers passed to response.writeHead(), with the headers passed
to response.writeHead() given precedence.
If response.writeHead() method is called and this method has not been
called, it will directly write the supplied header values onto the network
channel without caching internally, and the response.getHeader() on the
header will not yield the expected result. If progressive population of headers
is desired with potential future retrieval and modification, use
response.setHeader() instead of response.writeHead().
Sets the Socket's timeout value to msecs. If a callback is
provided, then it is added as a listener on the 'timeout' event on
the response object.
If no 'timeout' listener is added to the request, the response, or
the server, then sockets are destroyed when they time out. If a handler is
assigned to the request, the response, or the server's 'timeout' events,
timed out sockets must be handled explicitly.
Reference to the underlying socket. Usually users will not want to access
this property. In particular, the socket will not emit 'readable' events
because of how the protocol parser attaches to the socket. After
response.end(), the property is nulled.
This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specified a socket
type other than <net.Socket>.
When using implicit headers (not calling response.writeHead() explicitly),
this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when
the headers get flushed.
After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the
status code which was sent out.
When using implicit headers (not calling response.writeHead() explicitly),
this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when
the headers get flushed. If this is left as undefined then the standard
message for the status code will be used.
After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the
status message which was sent out.
If set to true, Node.js will check whether the Content-Length
header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal.
Mismatching the Content-Length header value will result
in an Error being thrown, identified by code: 'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'.
See writable.uncork().
Is true after response.end() has been called. This property
does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use
response.writableFinished instead.
Is true if all data has been flushed to the underlying system, immediately
before the 'finish' event is emitted.
The chunk parameter can now be a Uint8Array.
Added in: v0.1.29
If this method is called and response.writeHead() has not been called,
it will switch to implicit header mode and flush the implicit headers.
This sends a chunk of the response body. This method may
be called multiple times to provide successive parts of the body.
Writing to the body is not allowed when the request method or response status
do not support content. If an attempt is made to write to the body for a
HEAD request or as part of a 204 or 304response, a synchronous Error
with the code ERR_HTTP_BODY_NOT_ALLOWED is thrown.
chunk can be a string or a buffer. If chunk is a string,
the second parameter specifies how to encode it into a byte stream.
callback will be called when this chunk of data is flushed.
This is the raw HTTP body and has nothing to do with higher-level multi-part
body encodings that may be used.
The first time response.write() is called, it will send the buffered
header information and the first chunk of the body to the client. The second
time response.write() is called, Node.js assumes data will be streamed,
and sends the new data separately. That is, the response is buffered up to the
first chunk of the body.
Returns true if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel
buffer. Returns false if all or part of the data was queued in user memory.
'drain' will be emitted when the buffer is free again.
Sends an HTTP/1.1 100 Continue message to the client, indicating that
the request body should be sent. See the 'checkContinue' event on
Server.
Allow passing hints as an object.
Added in: v18.11.0
Sends an HTTP/1.1 103 Early Hints message to the client with a Link header,
indicating that the user agent can preload/preconnect the linked resources.
The hints is an object containing the values of headers to be sent with
early hints message. The optional callback argument will be called when
the response message has been written.
Example
Allow passing headers as an array.
Return this from writeHead() to allow chaining with end().
A RangeError is thrown if statusCode is not a number in the range [100, 999].
Added in: v0.1.30
Sends a response header to the request. The status code is a 3-digit HTTP
status code, like 404. The last argument, headers, are the response headers.
Optionally one can give a human-readable statusMessage as the second
argument.
headers may be an Array where the keys and values are in the same list.
It is not a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values,
and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. The array is in the same
format as request.rawHeaders.
Returns a reference to the ServerResponse, so that calls can be chained.
This method must only be called once on a message and it must
be called before response.end() is called.
If response.write() or response.end() are called before calling
this, the implicit/mutable headers will be calculated and call this function.
When headers have been set with response.setHeader(), they will be merged
with any headers passed to response.writeHead(), with the headers passed
to response.writeHead() given precedence.
If this method is called and response.setHeader() has not been called,
it will directly write the supplied header values onto the network channel
without caching internally, and the response.getHeader() on the header
will not yield the expected result. If progressive population of headers is
desired with potential future retrieval and modification, use
response.setHeader() instead.
Content-Length is read in bytes, not characters. Use
Buffer.byteLength() to determine the length of the body in bytes. Node.js
will check whether Content-Length and the length of the body which has
been transmitted are equal or not.
Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a [Error][] being thrown.
Sends a HTTP/1.1 102 Processing message to the client, indicating that
the request body should be sent.
The destroyed value returns true after the incoming data is consumed.
The readableHighWaterMark value mirrors that of the socket.
Added in: v0.1.17
An IncomingMessage object is created by http.Server or
http.ClientRequest and passed as the first argument to the 'request'
and 'response' event respectively. It may be used to access response
status, headers, and data.
Different from its socket value which is a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, the
IncomingMessage itself extends <stream.Readable> and is created separately to
parse and emit the incoming HTTP headers and payload, as the underlying socket
may be reused multiple times in case of keep-alive.


Emitted when the request has been aborted.
The close event is now emitted when the request has been completed and not when the underlying socket is closed.
Added in: v0.4.2
Emitted when the request has been completed.


The message.aborted property will be true if the request has
been aborted.
The message.complete property will be true if a complete HTTP message has
been received and successfully parsed.
This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or
server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated:


Alias for message.socket.
The function returns this for consistency with other Readable streams.
Added in: v0.3.0
Calls destroy() on the socket that received the IncomingMessage. If error
is provided, an 'error' event is emitted on the socket and error is passed
as an argument to any listeners on the event.
The joinDuplicateHeaders option in the http.request() and http.createServer() functions ensures that duplicate headers are not discarded, but rather combined using a comma separator, in accordance with RFC 9110 Section 5.3.
message.headers is now lazily computed using an accessor property on the prototype and is no longer enumerable.
Added in: v0.1.5
The request/response headers object.
Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased.
Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the
header name:
Similar to message.headers, but there is no join logic and the values are
always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once.
In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of
client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server.
Probably either '1.1' or '1.0'.
Also message.httpVersionMajor is the first integer and
message.httpVersionMinor is the second.
Only valid for request obtained from http.Server.
The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: 'GET', 'DELETE'.
The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received.
The keys and values are in the same list. It is not a
list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the
odd-numbered offsets are the associated values.
Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged.
The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were
received. Only populated at the 'end' event.
Calls message.socket.setTimeout(msecs, callback).
The net.Socket object associated with the connection.
With HTTPS support, use request.socket.getPeerCertificate() to obtain the
client's authentication details.
This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the <net.Socket> class,
a subclass of <stream.Duplex>, unless the user specified a socket
type other than <net.Socket> or internally nulled.
Only valid for response obtained from http.ClientRequest.
The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. 404.
Only valid for response obtained from http.ClientRequest.
The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. OK or Internal Server Error.
The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the 'end' event.
Similar to message.trailers, but there is no join logic and the values are
always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once.
Only populated at the 'end' event.
Only valid for request obtained from http.Server.
Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual
HTTP request. Take the following request:
To parse the URL into its parts:
When request.url is '/status?name=ryan' and request.headers.host is
'localhost:3000':
This class serves as the parent class of http.ClientRequest
and http.ServerResponse. It is an abstract outgoing message from
the perspective of the participants of an HTTP transaction.
Emitted when the buffer of the message is free again.
Emitted when the transmission is finished successfully.
Emitted after outgoingMessage.end() is called.
When the event is emitted, all data has been processed but not necessarily
completely flushed.
Adds HTTP trailers (headers but at the end of the message) to the message.
Trailers will only be emitted if the message is chunked encoded. If not,
the trailers will be silently discarded.
HTTP requires the Trailer header to be sent to emit trailers,
with a list of header field names in its value, e.g.
Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a TypeError being thrown.
Append a single header value for the header object.
If the value is an array, this is equivalent of calling this method multiple
times.
If there were no previous value for the header, this is equivalent of calling
outgoingMessage.setHeader(name, value).
Depending of the value of options.uniqueHeaders when the client request or the
server were created, this will end up in the header being sent multiple times or
a single time with values joined using ; .


Alias of outgoingMessage.socket.
See writable.cork().
Destroys the message. Once a socket is associated with the message
and is connected, that socket will be destroyed as well.
The chunk parameter can now be a Uint8Array.
add callback argument.
Added in: v0.1.90
Finishes the outgoing message. If any parts of the body are unsent, it will
flush them to the underlying system. If the message is chunked, it will
send the terminating chunk 0\r\n\r\n, and send the trailers (if any).
If chunk is specified, it is equivalent to calling
outgoingMessage.write(chunk, encoding), followed by
outgoingMessage.end(callback).
If callback is provided, it will be called when the message is finished
(equivalent to a listener of the 'finish' event).
Flushes the message headers.
For efficiency reason, Node.js normally buffers the message headers
until outgoingMessage.end() is called or the first chunk of message data
is written. It then tries to pack the headers and data into a single TCP
packet.
It is usually desired (it saves a TCP round-trip), but not when the first
data is not sent until possibly much later. outgoingMessage.flushHeaders()
bypasses the optimization and kickstarts the message.
Gets the value of the HTTP header with the given name. If that header is not
set, the returned value will be undefined.
Returns an array containing the unique names of the current outgoing headers.
All names are lowercase.
Returns a shallow copy of the current outgoing headers. Since a shallow
copy is used, array values may be mutated without additional calls to
various header-related HTTP module methods. The keys of the returned
object are the header names and the values are the respective header
values. All header names are lowercase.
The object returned by the outgoingMessage.getHeaders() method does
not prototypically inherit from the JavaScript Object. This means that
typical Object methods such as obj.toString(), obj.hasOwnProperty(),
and others are not defined and will not work.
Returns true if the header identified by name is currently set in the
outgoing headers. The header name is case-insensitive.
Read-only. true if the headers were sent, otherwise false.
Overrides the stream.pipe() method inherited from the legacy Stream class
which is the parent class of http.OutgoingMessage.
Calling this method will throw an Error because outgoingMessage is a
write-only stream.
Removes a header that is queued for implicit sending.
Sets a single header value. If the header already exists in the to-be-sent
headers, its value will be replaced. Use an array of strings to send multiple
headers with the same name.
Returns the response object.
Sets multiple header values for implicit headers.
headers must be an instance of Headers or Map,
if a header already exists in the to-be-sent headers,
its value will be replaced.
or
When headers have been set with outgoingMessage.setHeaders(),
they will be merged with any headers passed to response.writeHead(),
with the headers passed to response.writeHead() given precedence.
Once a socket is associated with the message and is connected,
socket.setTimeout() will be called with msecs as the first parameter.
Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access
this property.
After calling outgoingMessage.end(), this property will be nulled.
See writable.uncork()
The number of times outgoingMessage.cork() has been called.
Is true if outgoingMessage.end() has been called. This property does
not indicate whether the data has been flushed. For that purpose, use
message.writableFinished instead.
Is true if all data has been flushed to the underlying system.
The highWaterMark of the underlying socket if assigned. Otherwise, the default
buffer level when writable.write() starts returning false (16384).
The number of buffered bytes.
Always false.
The chunk parameter can now be a Uint8Array.
The callback argument was added.
Added in: v0.1.29
Sends a chunk of the body. This method can be called multiple times.
The encoding argument is only relevant when chunk is a string. Defaults to
'utf8'.
The callback argument is optional and will be called when this chunk of data
is flushed.
Returns true if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel
buffer. Returns false if all or part of the data was queued in the user
memory. The 'drain' event will be emitted when the buffer is free again.
A list of the HTTP methods that are supported by the parser.
A collection of all the standard HTTP response status codes, and the
short description of each. For example, http.STATUS_CODES[404] === 'Not Found'.
The highWaterMark option is supported now.
The requestTimeout, headersTimeout, keepAliveTimeout, and connectionsCheckingInterval options are supported now.
The noDelay option now defaults to true.
The noDelay, keepAlive and keepAliveInitialDelay options are supported now.
The maxHeaderSize option is supported now.
The insecureHTTPParser option is supported now.
The options argument is supported now.
Added in: v0.1.13
options <Object>
requestListener <Function>
Returns: <http.Server>
Returns a new instance of http.Server.
The requestListener is a function which is automatically
added to the 'request' event.
The url parameter can now be passed along with a separate options object.
The options parameter can be a WHATWG URL object.
Added in: v0.3.6
Since most requests are GET requests without bodies, Node.js provides this
convenience method. The only difference between this method and
http.request() is that it sets the method to GET by default and calls req.end()
automatically. The callback must take care to consume the response
data for reasons stated in http.ClientRequest section.
The callback is invoked with a single argument that is an instance of
http.IncomingMessage.
JSON fetching example:
The agent now uses HTTP Keep-Alive by default.
Added in: v0.5.9
Global instance of Agent which is used as the default for all HTTP client
requests.
Read-only property specifying the maximum allowed size of HTTP headers in bytes.
Defaults to 16 KiB. Configurable using the --max-http-header-size CLI
option.
This can be overridden for servers and client requests by passing the
maxHeaderSize option.
When using a URL object parsed username and password will now be properly URI decoded.
It is possible to abort a request with an AbortSignal.
The maxHeaderSize option is supported now.
The insecureHTTPParser option is supported now.
The url parameter can now be passed along with a separate options object.
The options parameter can be a WHATWG URL object.
Added in: v0.3.6
options in socket.connect() are also supported.
Node.js maintains several connections per server to make HTTP requests.
This function allows one to transparently issue requests.
url can be a string or a URL object. If url is a
string, it is automatically parsed with new URL(). If it is a URL
object, it will be automatically converted to an ordinary options object.
If both url and options are specified, the objects are merged, with the
options properties taking precedence.
The optional callback parameter will be added as a one-time listener for
the 'response' event.
http.request() returns an instance of the http.ClientRequest
class. The ClientRequest instance is a writable stream. If one needs to
upload a file with a POST request, then write to the ClientRequest object.
In the example req.end() was called. With http.request() one
must always call req.end() to signify the end of the request -
even if there is no data being written to the request body.
If any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution,
TCP level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an 'error' event is emitted
on the returned request object. As with all 'error' events, if no listeners
are registered the error will be thrown.
There are a few special headers that should be noted.
Sending a 'Connection: keep-alive' will notify Node.js that the connection to
the server should be persisted until the next request.
Sending a 'Content-Length' header will disable the default chunked encoding.
Sending an 'Expect' header will immediately send the request headers.
Usually, when sending 'Expect: 100-continue', both a timeout and a listener
for the 'continue' event should be set. See RFC 2616 Section 8.2.3 for more
information.
Sending an Authorization header will override using the auth option
to compute basic authentication.
Example using a URL as options:
In a successful request, the following events will be emitted in the following
order:
In the case of a connection error, the following events will be emitted:
In the case of a premature connection close before the response is received,
the following events will be emitted in the following order:
In the case of a premature connection close after the response is received,
the following events will be emitted in the following order:
If req.destroy() is called before a socket is assigned, the following
events will be emitted in the following order:
If req.destroy() is called before the connection succeeds, the following
events will be emitted in the following order:
If req.destroy() is called after the response is received, the following
events will be emitted in the following order:
If req.abort() is called before a socket is assigned, the following
events will be emitted in the following order:
If req.abort() is called before the connection succeeds, the following
events will be emitted in the following order:
If req.abort() is called after the response is received, the following
events will be emitted in the following order:
Setting the timeout option or using the setTimeout() function will
not abort the request or do anything besides add a 'timeout' event.
Passing an AbortSignal and then calling abort() on the corresponding
AbortController will behave the same way as calling .destroy() on the
request. Specifically, the 'error' event will be emitted with an error with
the message 'AbortError: The operation was aborted', the code 'ABORT_ERR'
and the cause, if one was provided.
The label parameter is added.
Added in: v14.3.0
Performs the low-level validations on the provided name that are done when
res.setHeader(name, value) is called.
Passing illegal value as name will result in a TypeError being thrown,
identified by code: 'ERR_INVALID_HTTP_TOKEN'.
It is not necessary to use this method before passing headers to an HTTP request
or response. The HTTP module will automatically validate such headers.
Example:
Performs the low-level validations on the provided value that are done when
res.setHeader(name, value) is called.
Passing illegal value as value will result in a TypeError being thrown.
It is not necessary to use this method before passing headers to an HTTP request
or response. The HTTP module will automatically validate such headers.
Examples:
Set the maximum number of idle HTTP parsers.

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
To learn about the way promises work and how you can use them, we advise you to read Using promises first.
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
A Promise is in one of these states:

  The eventual state of a pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error).
  When either of these options occur, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called. If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.

A promise is said to be settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.



You will also hear the term resolved used with promises — this means that the promise is settled or "locked-in" to match the eventual state of another promise, and further resolving or rejecting it has no effect. The States and fates document from the original Promise proposal contains more details about promise terminology. Colloquially, "resolved" promises are often equivalent to "fulfilled" promises, but as illustrated in "States and fates", resolved promises can be pending or rejected as well. For example:
This promise is already resolved at the time when it's created (because the resolveOuter is called synchronously), but it is resolved with another promise, and therefore won't be fulfilled until 1 second later, when the inner promise fulfills. In practice, the "resolution" is often done behind the scenes and not observable, and only its fulfillment or rejection are.
Note: Several other languages have mechanisms for lazy evaluation and deferring a computation, which they also call "promises", e.g. Scheme. Promises in JavaScript represent processes that are already happening, which can be chained with callback functions. If you are looking to lazily evaluate an expression, consider using a function with no arguments e.g. f = () => expression to create the lazily-evaluated expression, and f() to evaluate the expression immediately.
The methods Promise.prototype.then(), Promise.prototype.catch(), and Promise.prototype.finally() are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes settled. As these methods return promises, they can be chained.
The .then() method takes up to two arguments; the first argument is a callback function for the fulfilled case of the promise, and the second argument is a callback function for the rejected case. Each .then() returns a newly generated promise object, which can optionally be used for chaining; for example:
Processing continues to the next link of the chain even when a .then() lacks a callback function. Therefore, a chain can safely omit every rejection callback function until the final .catch().
Handling a rejected promise in each .then() has consequences further down the promise chain. Sometimes there is no choice, because an error must be handled immediately. In such cases we must throw an error of some type to maintain error state down the chain. On the other hand, in the absence of an immediate need, it is simpler to leave out error handling until a final .catch() statement. A .catch() is really just a .then() without a slot for a callback function for the case when the promise is fulfilled.
Using arrow functions for the callback functions, implementation of the promise chain might look something like this:
Note: For faster execution, all synchronous actions should preferably be done within one handler, otherwise it would take several ticks to execute all handlers in sequence.
The termination condition of a promise determines the "settled" state of the next promise in the chain. A "fulfilled" state indicates a successful completion of the promise, while a "rejected" state indicates a lack of success. The return value of each fulfilled promise in the chain is passed along to the next .then(), while the reason for rejection is passed along to the next rejection-handler function in the chain.
The promises of a chain are nested in one another, but get popped like the top of a stack. The first promise in the chain is most deeply nested and is the first to pop.
When a nextValue is a promise, the effect is a dynamic replacement. The return causes a promise to be popped, but the nextValue promise is pushed into its place. For the nesting shown above, suppose the .then() associated with "promise B" returns a nextValue of "promise X". The resulting nesting would look like this:
A promise can participate in more than one nesting. For the following code, the transition of promiseA into a "settled" state will cause both instances of .then() to be invoked.
An action can be assigned to an already "settled" promise. In that case, the action (if appropriate) will be performed at the first asynchronous opportunity. Note that promises are guaranteed to be asynchronous. Therefore, an action for an already "settled" promise will occur only after the stack has cleared and a clock-tick has passed. The effect is much like that of setTimeout(action, 0).
The JavaScript ecosystem had made multiple Promise implementations long before it became part of the language. Despite being represented differently internally, at the minimum, all Promise-like objects implement the Thenable interface. A thenable implements the .then() method, which is called with two callbacks: one for when the promise is fulfilled, one for when it's rejected. Promises are thenables as well.
To interoperate with the existing Promise implementations, the language allows using thenables in place of promises. For example, Promise.resolve will not only resolve promises, but also trace thenables.
The Promise class offers four static methods to facilitate async task concurrency:
Fulfills when all of the promises fulfill; rejects when any of the promises rejects.
Fulfills when all promises settle.
Fulfills when any of the promises fulfills; rejects when all of the promises reject.
Settles when any of the promises settles. In other words, fulfills when any of the promises fulfills; rejects when any of the promises rejects.
All these methods take an iterable of promises (thenables, to be exact) and return a new promise. They all support subclassing, which means they can be called on subclasses of Promise, and the result will be a promise of the subclass type. To do so, the subclass's constructor must implement the same signature as the Promise() constructor — accepting a single executor function that can be called with the resolve and reject callbacks as parameters. The subclass must also have a resolve static method that can be called like Promise.resolve() to resolve values to promises.
Note that JavaScript is single-threaded by nature, so at a given instant, only one task will be executing, although control can shift between different promises, making execution of the promises appear concurrent. Parallel execution in JavaScript can only be achieved through worker threads.
Creates a new Promise object. The constructor is primarily used to wrap functions that do not already support promises.
Returns the constructor used to construct return values from promise methods.
Takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises fulfill (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of the fulfillment values. It rejects when any of the input's promises reject, with this first rejection reason.
Takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises settle (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of objects that describe the outcome of each promise.
Takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when any of the input's promises fulfill, with this first fulfillment value. It rejects when all of the input's promises reject (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an AggregateError containing an array of rejection reasons.
Takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise settles with the eventual state of the first promise that settles.
Returns a new Promise object that is rejected with the given reason.
Returns a Promise object that is resolved with the given value. If the value is a thenable (i.e. has a then method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.
Returns an object containing a new Promise object and two functions to resolve or reject it, corresponding to the two parameters passed to the executor of the Promise() constructor.
These properties are defined on Promise.prototype and shared by all Promise instances.
The constructor function that created the instance object. For Promise instances, the initial value is the Promise constructor.
The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string "Promise". This property is used in Object.prototype.toString().
Appends a rejection handler callback to the promise, and returns a new promise resolving to the return value of the callback if it is called, or to its original fulfillment value if the promise is instead fulfilled.
Appends a handler to the promise, and returns a new promise that is resolved when the original promise is resolved. The handler is called when the promise is settled, whether fulfilled or rejected.
Appends fulfillment and rejection handlers to the promise, and returns a new promise resolving to the return value of the called handler, or to its original settled value if the promise was not handled (i.e. if the relevant handler onFulfilled or onRejected is not a function).
This example shows diverse techniques for using Promise capabilities and diverse situations that can occur. To understand this, start by scrolling to the bottom of the code block, and examine the promise chain. Upon provision of an initial promise, a chain of promises can follow. The chain is composed of .then() calls, and typically (but not necessarily) has a single .catch() at the end, optionally followed by .finally(). In this example, the promise chain is initiated by a custom-written new Promise() construct; but in actual practice, promise chains more typically start with an API function (written by someone else) that returns a promise.
The example function tetheredGetNumber() shows that a promise generator will utilize reject() while setting up an asynchronous call, or within the call-back, or both. The function promiseGetWord() illustrates how an API function might generate and return a promise in a self-contained manner.
Note that the function troubleWithGetNumber() ends with a throw. That is forced because a promise chain goes through all the .then() promises, even after an error, and without the throw, the error would seem "fixed". This is a hassle, and for this reason, it is common to omit onRejected throughout the chain of .then() promises, and just have a single onRejected in the final catch().
This code can be run under NodeJS. Comprehension is enhanced by seeing the errors actually occur. To force more errors, change the threshold values.
This small example shows the mechanism of a Promise. The testPromise() method is called each time the <button> is clicked. It creates a promise that will be fulfilled, using setTimeout(), to the promise count (number starting from 1) every 1-3 seconds, at random. The Promise() constructor is used to create the promise.
The fulfillment of the promise is logged, via a fulfill callback set using p1.then(). A few logs show how the synchronous part of the method is decoupled from the asynchronous completion of the promise.
By clicking the button several times in a short amount of time, you'll even see the different promises being fulfilled one after another.
Another simple example using Promise and XMLHttpRequest to load an image is available at the MDN GitHub js-examples repository. You can also see it in action. Each step is commented on and allows you to follow the Promise and XHR architecture closely.
A settings object is an environment that provides additional information when JavaScript code is running. This includes the realm and module map, as well as HTML specific information such as the origin. The incumbent settings object is tracked in order to ensure that the browser knows which one to use for a given piece of user code.
To better picture this, we can take a closer look at how the realm might be an issue. A realm can be roughly thought of as the global object. What is unique about realms is that they hold all of the necessary information to run JavaScript code. This includes objects like Array and Error. Each settings object has its own "copy" of these and they are not shared. That can cause some unexpected behavior in relation to promises. In order to get around this, we track something called the incumbent settings object. This represents information specific to the context of the user code responsible for a certain function call.
To illustrate this a bit further we can take a look at how an <iframe> embedded in a document communicates with its host. Since all web APIs are aware of the incumbent settings object, the following will work in all browsers:
The same concept applies to promises. If we modify the above example a little bit, we get this:
If we change this so that the <iframe> in the document is listening to post messages, we can observe the effect of the incumbent settings object:
In the above example, the inner text of the <iframe> will be updated only if the incumbent settings object is tracked. This is because without tracking the incumbent, we may end up using the wrong environment to send the message.
Note: Currently, incumbent realm tracking is fully implemented in Firefox, and has partial implementations in Chrome and Safari.

JSON is built on two structures:
These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern
programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense
that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also
be based on these structures.
In JSON, they take on these forms:
An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object
  begins with {left brace and ends
  with }right brace. Each name is followed
  by :colon and the name/value pairs are
  separated by ,comma.
An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins
  with [left bracket and ends
  with ]right bracket. Values are separated
  by ,comma.
A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number,
  or true or false or null, or an object or
  an array. These structures can be nested.
A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped
  in double quotes, using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a
  single character string. A string is very much like a C or Java string.
A number is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal
  and hexadecimal formats are not used.
Whitespace can be inserted between any pair of tokens. Excepting
  a few encoding details, that completely describes the language.

Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf[1]) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website or web application where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts.[2] There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript  fetch or XMLHttpRequests, for example, can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.[3]
In a CSRF attack, an innocent end user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a web request that they did not intend. This may cause actions to be performed on the website that can include inadvertent client or server data leakage, change of session state, or manipulation of an end user's account.

The term "CSRF" is also used as an abbreviation in defences against CSRF attacks, such as techniques that use header data, form data, or cookies, to test for and prevent such attacks.

In a CSRF attack, the attacker's goal is to cause an innocent victim to unknowingly submit a maliciously crafted web request to a website that the victim has privileged access to. This web request can be crafted to include URL parameters, cookies and other data that appear normal to the web server processing the request. At risk are web applications that perform actions based on input from trusted and authenticated users without requiring the user to authorize (e.g. via a popup confirmation) the specific action. A user who is authenticated by a cookie saved in the user's web browser could unknowingly send an HTTP request to a site that trusts the user and thereby cause an unwanted action.

A general property of web browsers is that they will automatically and invisibly include any cookies (including session cookies and others) used by a given domain in any web request sent to that domain. This property is exploited by CSRF attacks. In the event that a user is tricked into inadvertently submitting a request through their browser these automatically included cookies will cause the forged request to appear real to the web server and it will perform any appropriately requested actions including returning data, manipulating session state, or making changes to the victim's account.

In order for a CSRF attack to work, an attacker must identify a reproducible web request that executes a specific action such as changing an account password on the target page. Once such a request is identified, a link can be created that generates this malicious request and that link can be embedded on a page within the attacker's control.[1][4] This link may be placed in such a way that it is not even necessary for the victim to click the link. For example, it may be embedded within an html image tag on an email sent to the victim which will automatically be loaded when the victim opens their email. Once the victim has clicked the link, their browser will automatically include any cookies used by that website and submit the request to the web server. The web server will not be able to identify the forgery because the request was made by a user that was logged in, and submitted all the requisite cookies.

Cross-site request forgery is an example of a confused deputy attack against a web browser because the web browser is tricked into submitting a forged request by a less privileged attacker.

CSRF commonly has the following characteristics:

CSRF Token vulnerabilities have been known and in some cases exploited since 2001.[5] Because it is carried out from the user's IP address, some website logs might not have evidence of CSRF.[2] Exploits are under-reported, at least publicly, and as of 2007[6] there were few well-documented examples: 

New attacks against web-enabled devices were carried out in 2018, including attempts to change the DNS settings of routers. Some router manufacturers hurriedly released firmware updates to improve protection, and advised users to change router settings to reduce the risk. Details were not released, citing "obvious security reasons".[10]

Attackers who can find a reproducible link that executes a specific action on the target page while the victim is logged in can embed such link on a page they control and trick the victim into opening it.[1] The attack carrier link may be placed in a location that the victim is likely to visit while logged into the target site (for example, a discussion forum), or sent in an HTML email body or attachment. A real CSRF vulnerability in uTorrent (CVE-2008-6586) exploited the fact that its web console accessible at localhost:8080 allowed critical actions to be executed using a simple GET request:

Attacks were launched by placing malicious, automatic-action HTML image elements on forums and email spam, so that browsers visiting these pages would open them automatically, without much user action. People running vulnerable uTorrent version at the same time as opening these pages were susceptible to the attack.

CSRF attacks using image tags are often made from Internet forums, where users are allowed to post images but not JavaScript, for example using BBCode:

When accessing the attack link to the local uTorrent application at localhost:8080, the browser would also always automatically send any existing cookies for that domain. This general property of web browsers enables CSRF attacks to exploit their targeted vulnerabilities and execute hostile actions as long as the user is logged into the target website (in this example, the local uTorrent web interface) at the time of the attack.

In the uTorrent example described above, the attack was facilitated by the fact that uTorrent's web interface used GET request for critical state-changing operations (change credentials, download a file etc.), which RFC 2616 explicitly discourages:

In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.
Because of this assumption, many existing CSRF prevention mechanisms in web frameworks will not cover GET requests, but rather apply the protection only to HTTP methods that are intended to be state-changing.[11]

An attacker may forge a request to log the victim into a target website using the attacker's credentials; this is known as login CSRF. Login CSRF makes various novel attacks possible; for instance, an attacker can later log into the site with their legitimate credentials and view private information like activity history that has been saved in the account. This attack has been demonstrated against Google[12] and Yahoo.[13]

Depending on the type, the HTTP request methods vary in their susceptibility to the CSRF attacks (due to the differences in their handling by the web browsers). Therefore, the protective measures against an attack depend on the method of the HTTP request.

Additionally, while typically described as a static type of attack, CSRF can also be dynamically constructed as part of a payload for a cross-site scripting attack, as demonstrated by the Samy worm, or constructed on the fly from session information leaked via offsite content and sent to a target as a malicious URL. CSRF tokens could also be sent to a client by an attacker due to session fixation or other vulnerabilities, or guessed via a brute-force attack, rendered on a malicious page that generates thousands of failed requests. The attack class of "Dynamic CSRF", or using a per-client payload for session-specific forgery, was described[16] in 2009 by Nathan Hamiel and Shawn Moyer at the BlackHat Briefings,[17] though the taxonomy has yet to gain wider adoption.

A new vector for composing dynamic CSRF attacks was presented by Oren Ofer at a local OWASP chapter meeting in January 2012 – "AJAX Hammer – Dynamic CSRF".[18][19]

Severity metrics have been issued for CSRF token vulnerabilities that result in remote code execution with root privileges[20] as well as a vulnerability that can compromise a root certificate, which will completely undermine a public key infrastructure.[21]

Several things have to happen for cross-site request forgery to succeed:

The attack is blind: the attacker cannot see what the target website sends back to the victim in response to the forged requests, unless they exploit a cross-site scripting or other bug at the target website. Similarly, the attacker can only target any links or submit any forms that come up after the initial forged request if those subsequent links or forms are similarly predictable. (Multiple targets can be simulated by including multiple images on a page, or by using JavaScript to introduce a delay between clicks.)[23]

Most CSRF prevention techniques work by embedding additional authentication data into requests that allows the web application to detect requests from unauthorized locations.

Synchronizer token pattern (STP) is a technique where a token, a secret and unique value for each request, is embedded by the web application in all HTML forms and verified on the server side. The token may be generated by any method that ensures unpredictability and uniqueness (e.g. using a hash chain of random seed). This is called a anti-forgery token in ASP.NET. The attacker is thus unable to place a correct token in their requests to authenticate them.[1][24][25]

Example of STP set by Django in a HTML form:

STP is the most compatible as it only relies on HTML, but introduces some complexity on the server side, due to the burden associated with checking validity of the token on each request. As the token is unique and unpredictable, it also enforces proper sequence of events (e.g. screen 1, then 2, then 3) which raises usability problem (e.g. user opens multiple tabs). It can be relaxed by using per session CSRF token instead of per request CSRF token.

Web applications that use JavaScript for the majority of their operations may use the following anti-CSRF technique:

Security of this technique is based on the assumption that only JavaScript running on the client side of an HTTPS connection to the server that initially set the cookie will be able to read the cookie's value. JavaScript running from a rogue file or email should not be able to successfully read the cookie value to copy into the custom header. Even though the csrf-token cookie may be automatically sent with the rogue request, subject to the cookies SameSite policy, the server will still expect a valid X-Csrf-Token header.

The CSRF token itself should be unique and unpredictable. It may be generated randomly, or it may be derived from the session token using HMAC:

The CSRF token cookie must not have httpOnly flag, as it is intended to be read by JavaScript by design.

This technique is implemented by many modern frameworks, such as Django[26] and AngularJS.[27] Because the token remains constant over the whole user session, it works well with AJAX applications, but does not enforce sequence of events in the web application.

The protection provided by this technique can be thwarted if the target website disables its same-origin policy using one of the following techniques:

Similarly to the cookie-to-header approach, but without involving JavaScript, a site can set a CSRF token as a cookie, and also insert it as a hidden field in each HTML form. When the form is submitted, the site can check that the cookie token matches the form token. The same-origin policy prevents an attacker from reading or setting cookies on the target domain, so they cannot put a valid token in their crafted form.[30]

The advantage of this technique over the Synchronizer pattern is that the token does not need to be stored on the server.

An additional "SameSite" attribute can be included when the server sets a cookie, instructing the browser on whether to attach the cookie to cross-site requests. If this attribute is set to "strict", then the cookie will only be sent on same-site requests, making CSRF ineffective. However, this requires the browser to recognise and correctly implement the attribute.[31]

Browser extensions such as RequestPolicy (for Mozilla Firefox) or uMatrix (for both Firefox and Google Chrome/Chromium) can prevent CSRF by providing a default-deny policy for cross-site requests. However, this can significantly interfere with the normal operation of many websites. The CsFire extension (also for Firefox) can mitigate the impact of CSRF with less impact on normal browsing, by removing authentication information from cross-site requests.

The NoScript extension for Firefox mitigates CSRF threats by distinguishing trusted from untrusted sites, and removing authentication & payloads from POST requests sent by untrusted sites to trusted ones. The Application Boundary Enforcer module in NoScript also blocks requests sent from internet pages to local sites (e.g. localhost), preventing CSRF attacks on local services (such as uTorrent) or routers.

The Self Destructing Cookies extension for Firefox does not directly protect from CSRF, but can reduce the attack window, by deleting cookies as soon as they are no longer associated with an open tab.

Various other techniques have been used or proposed for CSRF prevention historically:

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (even in other applications running on the same domain) allow attackers to bypass essentially all CSRF preventions.[34]

このCookBookでは、Bloommaker で表を作成する時に「フレックスコンテナ」を使用する方法及び、メリットについてご紹介します。 

レンダリングに時間がかかる「テーブル」ではなく「フレックスコンテナ」を使用することで、パフォーマンスの低下を抑え、モバイルでも綺麗に画面をみせることができるようになります。


以下の完成サンプルをダウンロードしてご活用ください。このサンプルは、2021 Spring 版以降でインポートできます。
IM-BloomMaker インポートファイルには、以下の定義が含まれています。
IM-BloomMaker のインポート機能を利用してインポートしてください。インポート後、インポートしたルーティング定義の認可 URI の設定を行ってください。
ローカル環境で表示させる場合は、以下の URL にアクセスしてください。http://localhost:8080/imart/im_cookbook/227955なおベース URL である以下の部分は、環境に合わせて適宜変更してください。http://localhost:8080/imart


この CookBook の手順をお手元の環境で実施する場合は、コンテンツ種別「Bulma」のコンテンツを作成し使用してください。


表示するデータを作成します。
以下の zip データを解凍し、im_cookbook_227955_im_bloommaker_user_list.txt ファイルの中身をコピーしてください。
コンテンツのデザイン編集画面を開きます。
変数タブの「JSON形式で編集」アイコンをクリックし、コピーしたデータを張り付けてください。


フレックスコンテナにテーブルのような枠線を付けるため CSS を設定します。
「CSS編集」アイコンをクリックし、以下の CSS を張り付けてください。


1. コンテナページ配下に「コンテナ（レイアウト（Bulma）」 を配置します。

2. コンテナ内に「ボックス （レイアウト （Bulma）」を配置します。

3. ボックス内に以下のエレメントを配置します。
4. 見出しレベル3の「textContent」に「user_list」と入力します。 作成する表のタイトルです。

5. フレックスコンテナの「elementCount」を「4」に変更します。今回用意するのは「ID」「NAME」「EMAIL」「PHONE」の４種類のカラムです。
7. 各フレックスアイテムのCSSクラスの「クラス名」に「border」と入力します。上で設定した CSS を適用させテーブルのような枠線を付けます。
8. 前から順に各フレックスアイテムの「flexBasis」を以下の値に変更します。 
9. フレックスコンテナをコピーして ボックス（繰り返し）内に貼り付けます。

10. ボックス配下のフレックスコンテナの「背景色」に「#00CC99」を入力します。テーブルのヘッダの背景色になります。

11. 各フレックスアイテム内に強調ラベル（汎用 カテゴリ）を配置します。 

12. 各強調ラベルの「文字色」に「#eeeeee」を入力します。（テーブルのヘッダの文字色）テーブルのヘッダの文字色になります。

13. 前から順に各強調ラベルの「textContent」に以下の値を入力します。
14. ボックス（繰り返し）の「list」に「$variable.userList」をセットします。

16. ボックス（繰り返し）内の、各フレックスアイテム内にラベル（汎用 カテゴリ）を配置します。 

17. 前から順に各ラベルの「textContent」を変数値に変更し、以下の値を入力します。 
18. コンテンツを保存してください。
手順は以上です。プレビューを確認すると完成イメージのような表が出来ているはずです。

「テーブル」を使用して表を作成する場合と、「フレックスコンテナ」を使用して表を作成する場合の、見た目の違いを確認してみましょう。

上記の画像では、表の右側が画面から見切れています。

フレックスコンテナを使用すると、表が見切れずに折り返して表示されています。

CookBook 

															投稿日：2023-10-16								更新日：2023-10-23


このCookBookでは、IM-LogicDesigner での以下のBox連携LDタスクの使い方について紹介しています。
パブリックストレージに配置しておいたファイルをBoxにアップロードし、そのファイルに対してメタデータと共有リンクを作成するサンプルです。
あらかじめBoxに登録してあるメタデータテンプレートを使用します。
以下の完成サンプルをダウンロードしてご活用ください。
このサンプルは、2023 Autumn 版以降でインポートできます。
LogicDesignerインポートデータ： cookbook_203865_logicdesigner.zip
IM-LogicDesigner のインポート画面からインポートしてください。
インポートすると、以下のデータが登録されます。
・フロー定義 … フロー定義ID： im_cookbook_203865_flow_box
メタデータのテンプレートがBoxに登録されていることを確認しましょう。
登録されていない場合は、下記サンプルのように設定してください。

※「テンプレートの名前」は、半角英数字のみを入力し、作成後は名前を変更しないことを推奨します。
（テンプレートの名前とメタデータテンプレートキーの間に差異を生まないため）
※「属性の名前」についても、半角英数字のみを入力し、作成後は名前を変更しないことを推奨します。
次の章で定数「PUBLIC_STORAGE」に指定するパブリックストレージのパスに、ファイルを配置しましょう。
サンプルではbox/cookbook203865/test.txtとしています。
(1) 「システム管理」→「ファイル操作」をクリックします。
(2) 左側のツリーからディレクトリを作成したい位置をクリックします。
サンプルではstorageディレクトリ直下に、ディレクトリを作成します。
「Create directory」をクリックし、「Create directory」画面からディレクトリを作成します。


(3) ディレクトリが作成できたら、ファイルをアップロードします。
ファイルをアップロードしたいディレクトリをクリックします。
「Add files」をクリックし、ファイル選択ダイアログからアップロードしたいファイルを選択します。


(4) ファイルを配置(アップロード)できたことを確認します。

実際にBox連携を行うフロー定義を作成しましょう。
「サイトマップ」→「IM-LogicDesigner」→「フロー定義一覧」→「新規作成」をクリックします。
フロー定義の処理の流れは、以下の通りです。
1. ユーザ切り替え (「User Switching」タスク)
2. Boxストレージ取得 (「Get Box Storage」タスク)
3. パブリックストレージ取得 (「Public Storage Acquisition」タスク)
4. ストレージファイル読み込み（バイナリ） (「Load Storage File (Binary)」タスク)
5. ストレージ出力（バイナリ） (「Storage Output (binary)」タスク)
6. メタデータ作成 (「Create Meta Data」タスク)
7. 共有リンク作成 (「Create Shared Link」タスク)
8. データを返却して終了 (「End」タスク)
フロー定義の全体像は、以下の通りです。

必要なパラメータを定数設定に登録してください。
・BOX_STORAGE … ファイルをアップロードする先のBoxストレージのパス
・PUBLIC_STORAGE … パブリックストレージのパス
・TEMPLATE_NAME … メタデータのテンプレートキー
・USER_ID … 接続先のBoxユーザID

フロー定義の「入力」を設定します。
ツールバーの「入出力設定」をクリックして、「入力」に以下を定義します。
・metadata_input … <map>

フロー定義の「出力」を設定します。
ツールバーの「入出力設定」をクリックして、「出力」に以下を定義します。
・shared_link_url … <string>

それぞれマッピング設定を行います。
(1) 接続先のBoxユーザを指定する。(ユーザ切り替え)
接続先のBoxユーザを指定するため、 boxUserId を以下のようにマッピングしてください。

(2) Boxストレージを取得する。(Boxストレージ取得)
Box上のファイルに相当する仮想的なストレージを取得するため、im_boxGetBoxStorage1 を以下のようにマッピングしてください。
アップロード対象のファイルの、Boxのルートフォルダからの絶対パスをここで指定しています。

(3) パブリックストレージを取得する。(パブリックストレージ取得)
パブリックストレージ内のファイルへアクセスするため、im_publicStorage1 を以下のようにマッピングしてください。
Boxにアップロードするファイルの、パブリックストレージのパスをここで指定しています。

(4) ストレージファイルを読み込み、その結果をバイナリデータで返す。(ストレージファイル読み込み（バイナリ）)
こちらのタスクでは、パブリックストレージからファイルを読み込みます。
入力対象となるストレージを指定するため、im_readBinaryToStorage1 を以下のようにマッピングしてください。

(5) ストレージにバイナリデータを出力する。(ストレージ出力（バイナリ）)
出力するバイナリデータ、出力先を指定するため、binary 、 storage を以下のようにマッピングしてください。
ここでは、Boxストレージを指定してデータを出力することで、ファイルのアップロードを実施しています。

(6) 指定したファイル・フォルダにメタデータを作成する。(メタデータ作成)
指定したファイルにメタデータを作成するため、metadata 、 path 、 templateName を以下のようにマッピングしてください。
前章で確認したメタデータテンプレートのテンプレートキーを指定しています。
メタデータの内容は入力値から取得しています。

(7) 指定したファイル・フォルダの共有リンクを作成する。(共有リンク作成)
指定したファイルの共有リンクを作成するため、path を以下のようにマッピングしてください。

(8) 作成した共有リンクを出力する。(データを返却して終了)
作成した共有リンクを出力して確認するため、shared_link_url を以下のようにマッピングしてください。

これでフロー定義の準備は完了です。保存しておきましょう。
次に、実際にフロー定義を実行しましょう。
保存したフロー定義を開き、ツールバーの「デバッグ」をクリックします。
「フロー定義のデバッグ」ウィンドウが開いたら、「実行」をクリックします。
入力ダイアログが表示されたら、以下のように入力をします。
ここで入力するmapのキー名は、確認したメタデータテンプレートの属性名と一致させる必要があります。
サンプルではtextとしています。

「決定」をクリックすると、フローの実行が始まります。
正常にBox連携操作ができた場合、「フローの実行が正常終了しました。」メッセージが表示されます。
また、出力欄のshared_link_url に作成した共有リンクURLが表示されます。

フロー定義実行後、前章で指定したパスにファイルがアップロードされ、共有リンクが作成されていることを確認します。

次に、前章で作成した共有リンクURLへアクセスし、ファイルが開けることを確認します。
最後に、開いたファイルに対して、メタデータが作成されていることを確認します。
前章のフロー定義実行時に入力したmapの値Hello! Cookbookが、メタデータに設定されていることが確認できます。

このように、IM-LogicDesignerを使用すると、Boxへのファイルのアップロードや、ファイルの操作をノンコーディングで実現できます。
ぜひお試しください。

コメントありがとうございます。
CookBook内には下記のように注記しているのですが、日本語利用されたいですよね。。
—-
※「テンプレートの名前」は、半角英数字のみを入力し、作成後は名前を変更しないことを推奨します。
（テンプレートの名前とメタデータテンプレートキーの間に差異を生まないため）
※「属性の名前」についても、半角英数字のみを入力し、作成後は名前を変更しないことを推奨します。
—-
後日回避策をドキュメントにてご案内予定ですので、よろしければそちらもご覧頂けますと幸いです。
ドキュメントのコラムでも良いですが、
　メタデータのテンプレート定義が2バイト文字のケース
　テンプレート定義の項目名が「承認日」などの2バイト文字のケース
　テンプレート定義の項目が日付型で設定されているケース
についての補足が必要かと思います。

Accel Platform 2023 Autumnで、文字列型変数の入力規則に「最大の文字数」「最小の文字数」が追加されました。
一見似ている「長さ」「文字数」「バイト数」という入力規則をどうやって使い分ければいいのでしょうか。
また、変数の「入力規則」とテキスト入力エレメントなどが持つ「MaxLength」プロパティをどうやって使い分ければいいのでしょうか。
この記事でご紹介していきます。
以下の完成サンプルをダウンロードしてご活用ください。このサンプルは、2023 Autumn 版以降でインポートできます。
以下の定義が含まれています。




IM-BloomMaker のインポート機能を利用してインポートしてください。インポート後、インポートしたルーティング定義の認可 URI の設定を行ってください。
ローカル環境で表示させる場合は、以下のURLにアクセスしてください。http://localhost:8080/imart/im_cookbook/bloommaker/232362なおベースURLである以下の部分は、環境に合わせて適宜変更してください。
http://localhost:8080/imart
それでは、「長さ」「文字数」「バイト数」の違いを見ていきましょう。
左から順に、変数の「最大の長さ」、「最大の文字数」、「最大のバイト数」を5に設定しています。
まずは、アルファベット、数字を入れてみます。
（※入力規則に反すると、テキスト入力エレメントの枠が赤色に変わります。）
「長さ」と「文字数」と「バイト数」は全く同じ結果になりました。
次に、ひらがなを入れてみましょう。
「長さ」と「文字数」は全く同じ結果になりました。「バイト数」だけ異なる結果になりましたね。
これは、ひらがながマルチバイト文字（1文字が2バイト以上で表される文字）だからです。
変数をデータベースに格納する場合にデータベース側のバリデーションチェックと合わせて「バイト数」を入力規則に設定する等の使い方が想定されます。
次に「𩸽（ほっけ）」という文字を入れて、「長さ」と「文字数」の違いを見ていきましょう。
先程までは同じ結果だった、「長さ」と「文字数」の結果に差が出ましたね。
これは「𩸽（ほっけ）」という文字が、サロゲートペア文字（UTF-16の4バイトで表現される文字）だからです。
最後に、絵文字を入れてみましょう。
こちらも、「𩸽（ほっけ）」と同様に、「長さ」と「文字数」の結果に差が出ました。じつは、絵文字も𩸽（ほっけ）と同様にサロゲートペア文字です。
以上のように、「長さ」「文字数」「バイト数」は、似ているように見えても、結果が異なる場合があるのですね。「長さ」と「文字数」は、サロゲートペア文字も考慮して文字数制限したいかどうかで決めると良さそうです。

では次に、「入力規則」と「MaxLength」はどのような使い分けが考えられるか、見ていきましょう。
「入力規則」は、デザイナ画面の変数エディタから設定できるものです。
「MaxLength」とは、テキスト入力エレメントなどが持つ、プロパティの一つです。
つまり、入力規則は変数に紐づくバリデーションチェックで、MaxLengthはエレメントに紐づくバリデーションチェックであるという違いがあります。
具体的なそれぞれの使い方を示します。
こちらは、入力規則の「最大の長さ」に5を設定しています。テキスト入力が設定した値を超すと、枠が赤くなり、下にエラーメッセージが表示されました。
このように、入力規則には、「入力規則エラーメッセージ」エレメントが2021 Springで追加されています。
入力者にバリデーションエラーを気づかせたい時に使うと便利そうです。
「入力規則エラーメッセージ」エレメントの詳細は、以下のCookBookをご覧ください。
https://dev.intra-mart.jp/cookbook194891/

次に「MaxLength」を見てみましょう。「テキスト入力」エレメントのプロパティ「MaxLength」に5を設定しています。6文字以上の文字を貼り付けようとすると、5文字を越した部分が入力欄に反映されなくなりました。
このように、「MaxLength」を設定することで、制限文字数を超すと入力が反映されなくなることがわかります。強制的に制限文字数以下にしたいときに便利そうですね。

CookBook

このCookBookでは、リッチテーブルエレメントで大量のデータを扱う時にデータの読み込みを速くする方法について紹介しています。
intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Autumn でリッチテーブルエレメントに追加されたプロパティを利用することで、読み込みを速くできます。
intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Autumn より前のバージョンではできないので注意してください。
intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Spring 以前は、リッチテーブルで扱うデータは最初に全て読み込む必要がありました。
扱うデータの数が多くなるほど読み込みに時間がかかり、パフォーマンス劣化の原因となってしまいます。
最初の読み込みで全てのデータを取得するのではなく、検索やページの切り替えを行うたびに必要なデータのみを取得することで読み込みにかかる時間を短縮してパフォーマンスの悪化を防ぐことができます。
intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Autumn でリッチテーブルエレメントに「pagingType」プロパティが追加されました。このプロパティの設定値を「manual」にすると、テーブルデータの総件数に任意の値を表示できるようになります。
同じく intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Autumn で追加された「currentPage」「totalCount」「interactiveNavigationEvent」プロパティと組み合わせることで、ページの切替や検索、ソート実行のたびにデータ取得処理を呼び出して必要最小限のデータを取得する、という動作を実現できます。
intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Spring 以前と同様に最初に全てのデータを読み込みたい場合は「pagingType」プロパティの設定値を「auto」にしてください。
この CookBook でサンプルを紹介します。
この CookBook で説明に使用するサンプルのインポートファイルです。
intra-mart Accel Platform 2023 Autumn 以降のバージョンで利用できます。
IM-LogicDesigner のインポートファイルは、IM-LogicDesigner のインポート画面からインポートしてください。
IM-BloomMaker のインポートファイルは、IM-BloomMaker のインポート画面からインポートしてください。
IM-LogicDesigner のインポートファイル : im_cookbook_234055_im_logicdesigner-data.zip
IM-BloomMaker のインポートファイル : im_cookbook_234055_im_bloommaker-data.zip
インポート完了後、テナント環境セットアップでサンプルデータのセットアップを行い、以下のそれぞれのロジックフロールーティング定義、および、IM-BloomMaker のルーティング定義に認可設定を行ってください。
リッチテーブルに表示するデータをデータベースから取得する処理を実装します。今回は IM-LogicDesigner のロジックフローで行います。
リッチテーブルのプロパティを設定します。
各プロパティの詳細は、デザイナ画面のヘルプ、または、ユーザ操作ガイドを参照してください。
IM-BloomMaker for Accel Platform IM-BloomMaker ユーザ操作ガイド
「pagingType」プロパティは「paging」プロパティが「true」の場合のみ有効のため、チェックをつける必要があります。
「pagingType」プロパティの設定値を「manual」にすることで、リッチテーブルの総件数を「totalCount」プロパティから指定できるようになります。
「pagingType」プロパティの設定値を「auto」にした場合、「dataSource」プロパティに指定したデータの件数がリッチテーブルの総件数として扱われます。
リッチテーブルの現在ページは「currentPage」プロパティに指定した変数に格納されます。データの取得開始位置を決めるために使用します。
1ページあたりの表示件数は「rowsPerPage」プロパティに指定した変数に格納されます。データの取得件数を決めるために使用します。
上記で説明した通り、「pagingType」プロパティの設定値が「manual」の場合は「totalCount」プロパティに指定した値がデータの総件数になります。
変数「$variable.countApiResponse.count」にはデータ件数を取得する API から取得した件数を格納しています。
簡易検索のテキストボックスに入力された内容は「simpleSearchText」プロパティに指定した変数に格納されます。
今回はユーザコードの検索条件として使用しています。
今回のサンプルでは複数の列で並び替えできるようにしています。
ソート条件は「sortConditions」プロパティに設定した変数に格納されます。
今回は変数をそのままロジックフローに渡し、ロジックフロー側で SQL に埋め込める形に加工しています。
リッチテーブルでページの切り替え、簡易検索、ソート、1ページあたりの表示件数の変更を行うと、「interactiveNavigationEvent」プロパティに設定されたアクションが実行されます。
「Search Process」アクションは、上記の手順でプロパティに設定した値を使ってデータ取得を行うロジックフローを呼び出します。
なお、「currentPage」や「rowsPerPage」プロパティなどに指定した変数の値を直接書き換えた場合、アクションは実行されません。

いつも思うのですがなぜロケールが英語なんでしょう？
ロケールを日本語とすると、海外のユーザが記事を読んだ際に読めないためです。
本文はブラウザの機能などで翻訳することが可能ですが、画像内の文章は翻訳することが困難です。
画面右下の言語切り替えのプルダウンで機械翻訳を行うことも可能です。
日本国内のお客様にはご不便をおかけしますが、ご理解いただけますようお願いします。

趣味にはさまざまなものがある。 私はゲーム好きが高じて株主総会のレポートを毎年書いたり、映画館でペンライトを振って歓声をあげる応援上映にのめりこんで同じ映画を何十回も観たりしている。 最近、新たにTwitter(Xともいう)におけるスパム報告が趣味に加わった。 [2024年2月20日現在 31000件ほど凍結確認済み] こちらは、記録に残している凍結済みアカウントのリストだ。2023年9月下旬から記録をあつめて、半年ほどで3万アカウントに達した。 他に、未凍結のスパムリストが5000件ほどある。 Twitter(現在はXと呼ばれる)のスパムといえば、バズったツイートに他のツイートをコピーしたり、自動生成したような文章でリプライを投げる青バッジ付きの「インプレゾンビ」が大活躍中だが、検索で拾いにくい上に凍結が容易ではないという理由で対象にしていない。 対象のスパム 現在は以下の4つを対象とし

ほかに比べたらぜんぜん安いっていうか、かなり安いと思うんだけど。 高くなったっていっても1万超えの商品なんかは限られてるし。コートぐらいじゃない？ 数千円でまだ服が買えるってかなり安いっていうか、ほかの店だと一万超えが普通じゃない？ え？自分が変なんだろうか？ 古着屋も高くなって中古なのにユニクロより高いよね。 同格のブランドだと無印が思い浮かぶけど、ユニクロより高いしなぁ。 あと無印は部屋着感がすごくて外で着れなくない？ ジーンズメイトもぜんぜん高いよなあ。 ユニクロより安い服屋ってどこなんだろう。

鉄道の駅に設置されているホームドア。転落事故の防止に大きな効果を発揮しますが、都のまとめでは、都内の駅の設置率は、2023年3月現在、半数程度にとどまります。 こうした中、都営地下鉄では2月20日、設置率は100％となりました。最後に設置された押上駅のある浅草線は、5つの事業者による相互直通運転が行われ、ホームドアの設置は鬼門とされてきました。事業者それぞれで経営規模や車両が異なるため、足並みを揃えて高額な整備費用を負担できるかどうかが不透明だったためです。 しかし、今回、当初想定された車両改修コストは740分の1にまで抑えられ、ホームドアの全駅設置が実現しました。その立て役者となったのは2次元コードでした。

コンテンツ制作側は意外と儲からないという話をしておきたい電子書籍の分配について、作家さんやマンガ家さんからいろいろな論が出ている。出版社が暴利を取っている、搾取しているという論もあるが、割とそんなこともないぞという話。 電子書籍販売のプレイヤーと主な料率下記料率は主にグロス売上（一般的な小売価格ベース）に対する比率。ただし値引き時などは原資負担を出版社が行うケースもあれば、流通や電子書店が行うケースなど様々なのでそのあたりの特殊事例は考慮してない数字。 もちろん、会社や相手によってさまざまなので、ざっくりこの辺りが多いよねという数字でしかない。 クリエイター（マンガ家、小説家など）　25％程度 編集・出版・制作（おもに出版社とその業務委託先）　　15％程度 流通（おもに電子取次、ebookjapanとかメディアドゥとか）　10％程度 販売店（電子書店、AmazonとかKoboとか）　　20

最近読んでめっちゃ良かった本が下記の本だ。現在Amazonを見たら総合で３５位で、星の評価が５つと半端ない。著者の方は以前から YouTube 動画などで勉強させていただいてたが、本が出たので速攻で買った。 勉強法とか大好物の自分としては読むしかないと思って買った。これは星５つは間違いない出来であった。さっそく自分も著者のメソッドを実施してみた。 実はこの本は、この本で紹介されている、そして私もそう思っている科学的に証明されたメソッドが効果の高い順から掲載されている。しかも、この本の面白いところは、この本のメソッドが本を読みながら各テクニックを体験できるところなので、ぜひ紙と書くものを用意して本を開いてほしい。 説明しないけど、多分こんな感じになる。わしは字が汚いので読めないだろう。　あんまし内容を書くとネタバレになったら申し訳ないので書かないけど、自分がめっちゃくちゃ嬉しかったことを書い

Published 2024/02/21 16:49 (JST) Updated 2024/02/21 17:01 (JST) 山梨県が、報道各社による長崎幸太郎知事への個別インタビュー取材を巡り、自民党派閥の政治資金パーティー裏金事件に関連する質問を扱わないよう求めたことが21日分かった。要請に応じなかった1社が取材を拒否された。県内の報道各社が加盟する山梨県政記者クラブは21日、長崎氏宛てに抗議文を提出。「意に沿わない報道に圧力をかけた」と批判した。 長崎氏が代表を務める資金管理団体は、裏金事件で元会計責任者が立件された自民二階派からの寄付金1182万円を政治資金収支報告書に記載しなかった。 抗議文でクラブ側は県側の対応に関し、憲法が保障する言論と表現の自由を脅かしかねないと指摘。「質問規制は異例で、到底受け入れられない」と強調し、説明責任を果たすよう求めた。抗議文は県広聴広報グループ

山梨県が、報道各社による長崎幸太郎知事への個別インタビュー取材を巡り、自民党派閥の政治資金パーティー裏金事件に関連する質問を扱わないよう求めたことが21日分かった。要請に応じなかった1社が取材を拒否された。県内の報道各社が加盟する山梨県政記者クラブは21日、長崎氏宛てに抗議文を提出。「意に沿わない報道に圧力をかけた」と批判した。 長崎氏が代表を務める資金管理団体は、裏金事件で元会計責任者が立件された自民二階派からの寄付金1182万円を政治資金収支報告書に記載しなかった。 抗議文でクラブ側は県側の対応に関し、憲法が保障する言論と表現の自由を脅かしかねないと指摘。「質問規制は異例で、到底受け入れられない」と強調し、説明責任を果たすよう求めた。抗議文は県広聴広報グループの幹部も対象とした。 インタビューは5～14日、クラブ加盟の新聞・通信、テレビなど計11社が順次実施。県側は質問の事前提出を求め

（ＣＮＮ） ウクライナのクレバ外相は２０日、ＣＮＮの取材に対し、ウクライナ東部の要衝アウジーイウカについて、ウクライナが「防衛に必要な弾薬をすべて受け取っていれば」アウジーイウカを失うことはなかっただろうと述べた。 クレバ氏は、ウクライナの兵士らがロシアに立ち向かい、最前線で命を捧げたことを称賛されなければならないと述べた。 クレバ氏は、ウクライナ軍の兵士が自らを犠牲にして死ななければならなかったのは、誰かが決定について議論しているためだと指摘。国内政治を尊重し、介入するつもりはないとした上で、「ある場所での議論の日々は、別の場所での死を意味することを全員に覚えておいてほしい」と語った。 クレバ氏は、戦争は続き、ロシアが休止することはないとの見方を示した。

（ＣＮＮ） 良好な保存状態で見つかった２億８０００万年前の古代爬虫（はちゅう）類の化石とされる標本は、実は作り物だったとする調査結果がこのほど発表された。 問題の化石はイタリアのアルプスで１９３１年に発見されて「トリデンティノサウルス・アンティクウス」と命名され、イタリアのパドバ大学自然人類博物館が収蔵している。岩の上に残された黒っぽいトカゲのような痕跡は皮膚や組織と考えられ、初期の爬虫類の進化を探る手がかりになると考えられた。 この化石は長年にわたって文献にも引用されたが、これまで詳しい調査が行われたことはなかった。同じような標本がほかには見つかっていないことから、この生物の生態をめぐって多くの疑問が浮上していた。 そこで研究チームが詳しく調べた結果、化石の黒っぽい色は保全された遺伝物質ではなく、数本の骨と、刻んだ岩の上に塗られた単なる塗料だったことが分かった。この研究は、１５日に古生物

2024年2月14日、宮城県石巻市は2023年9月に発生したシステム障害について原因がSSDの重大なファームウエア不具合であったと公表しました。ここでは関連する情報をまとめます。 重大な不具合情報が共有されずシステム障害発生 2023年9月当時にシステム障害が発生したのは石巻市本庁内で稼働する戸籍情報システム。システムが稼働するサーバー上で使用していたSSDの不具合によりバックアップサーバーを含めてシステム停止が起こり、市役所やコンビニなどで戸籍証明書の発行が行えない事態となった。2日後には最新の戸籍証明書の写しは発行できるようになった*1ものの、完全復旧（除籍や改製原戸籍の証明書発行）には約1か月（2023年9月20日～2023年10月18日）を要することとなった。 障害影響が長期化した理由として、市は当該システム上で取り扱うデータが戸籍にかかわるもので、復旧方法および突合などに万全を期

It is relatively easy to find online casinos that don’t use GamStop. But, ranking them so you know which one is the best and what to expect isn’t. That’s why we had to develop a system that allows us to do precisely that without a single mistake. It is based on 4 parameters you can see below explained. Thanks to our unique system, finding the best site is easy and simple.
The main section here is this one. Here we will explain and review the best casinos that offer all the perks you can imagine and something even more. Each site was properly tested by our team and all main aspects have been analyzed to the smallest detail. In a nutshell, you can play at a casino you like the most. Here is the list of casinos not on GamStop for UK players:

VeloBet Casino is one of the most recent sites to join the GamStop-free casino market having launched in the summer of 2023. However, don’t let that concern you as it’s also operated by Santeda International B.V., the respected brand behind many other leading sites.
New players can unlock a very generous 150% on their first deposit of up to €500.

Here you can see both, important things. Yummy Wins Casino site has a responsible gaming page located at the bottom of the main page and also Curacao eGaming licence. These two things made it an appealing option for players who are under GamStop self-exclusion.
The software developers come in high numbers. All names can be seen here. Casino games, both live and ordinary are available. Also, every player can enjoy tournaments and lotteries. Also, there are other options presented. This is a good casino site not covered by GamStop that also has high and versatile promotions ready for you. Customer support is one of the best in the industry.
Here we have good news. If you are looking for more casinos, you can find them below. There are many sites that met our requirements so we had to create an additional list. All of these are fair, safe and they do offer all the perks you will need and want while gambling. Anyway, here is the additional list of trusted casinos not on GamStop:
There are different types of casinos that are not members of GamStop. These are different variations and they look the same, but they are far from that. Before you decide where you want to gamble, it would be a wise decision to take a look at the types we have discovered. Here are the types of British casino sites not blocked by GamStop:
Which games can you play at these casinos? There are plenty of games not on GamStop which is a nice thing. However, all of them can be categorized. These are different types of games that are very popular, appealing and they basically allow you to enjoy a type of game you like. At these casinos, you can play:
A payment method can be the most important thing a gambler is looking for. You need a method that is easy to use, already available for you and comes with small fees. As such, you need options. There are several alternatives that are very desirable and popular today. Here is the list of options when it comes to online casinos not covered by GamStop:
Software developers are something that can make a casino stunning, great or not so great. More brands mean more games and more options. Although there are countless variations in this case scenario, we were able to find the best ones. Here is the list of software developers and casinos exempt from GamStop:
We don’t believe in perfection. All UK-based casinos that are not on GamStop do come with a unique set of pros and cons. In other terms, these are advantages and drawbacks. Don’t worry, all sites have them. It is important to explain to them so you know precisely what you are getting.
All non GamStop online casinos operating in the United Kingdom come with 3 impressive benefits that most players love and want to see as much as possible. They do make a difference and they can help you have a better gambling experience.
Casino companies without British exclusion scheme come with certain drawbacks. We were able to see a couple of these at any casino but the total outcome cannot be generalized. Anyway, try to see which drawbacks a casino has where you want to gamble.
It is important to add that all of these casinos must have a licence or two. A licence means that the casino is a safe and fair place to gamble and win. Non GamStop UK casinos for local players usually have just one licence. Available options are listed below.
Yes, this network affects online casinos and a lot of them. Keep in mind that this is an online system so it cannot be used for mortar casinos. GamStop doesn’t have anything to do with land-based casinos and your self-exclusion won’t be effective in that case scenario. The situation is the same with other networks of the same type.
Most if not all casinos that have the United Kingdom Gambling Commission licence are members of GamStop. This gambling authority provider makes sure that casinos accept GamStop in order to add a protection layer to their offerings and eliminate the risk of addiction. Casinos that do not have this licence are rarely members of the network or other blocking systems.
No, not all casinos use this network. When the self-exclusion scheme was approved by UKGC the majority of casino sites joined it. Despite this, we can see almost countless international gambling sites that are not members of the network. However, not all of them accept players from the United Kingdom. It is important to find a casino that will accept your account and where you have rights.
Yes, there are a few options to choose from. We have covered all of those alternatives above in our list. Your only task is to go back, check the best casinos and choose the one you want to visit. Keep in mind that all of them have an excellent selection of games and promos ready for you.
Yes, it is possible to get a self-exclusion feature at casinos that are not members of GamStop. You will need to contact their customer support and ask them to ban or block your account. This is a simple task that can be completed within minutes. You will need to do that for each casino.
There are a few casinos we would like to recommend in this case scenario. But, we chose Very Well Casino. This site offers amazing promotions, even better games, and all kinds of other perks you will want to check out and enjoy. It is a safe and extremely popular option for many gamblers in the UK.
The correct way is casinos not on GamStop and here is why. GamStop is a self-exclusion program for UK gamblers, while GameStop is a company that sells stuff for gamers. It is really confusing for many people as both these terms appeared approximately at one time.

Here we have good news. If you are looking for more casinos, you can find them below. There are many sites that met our requirements so we had to create an additional list. All of these are fair, safe and they do offer all the perks you will need and want while gambling. Anyway, here is the additional list of trusted casinos not on GamStop:
There are different types of casinos that are not members of GamStop. These are different variations and they look the same, but they are far from that. Before you decide where you want to gamble, it would be a wise decision to take a look at the types we have discovered. Here are the types of British casino sites not blocked by GamStop:
Which games can you play at these casinos? There are plenty of games not on GamStop which is a nice thing. However, all of them can be categorized. These are different types of games that are very popular, appealing and they basically allow you to enjoy a type of game you like. At these casinos, you can play:
A payment method can be the most important thing a gambler is looking for. You need a method that is easy to use, already available for you and comes with small fees. As such, you need options. There are several alternatives that are very desirable and popular today. Here is the list of options when it comes to online casinos not covered by GamStop:
Software developers are something that can make a casino stunning, great or not so great. More brands mean more games and more options. Although there are countless variations in this case scenario, we were able to find the best ones. Here is the list of software developers and casinos exempt from GamStop:
We don’t believe in perfection. All UK-based casinos that are not on GamStop do come with a unique set of pros and cons. In other terms, these are advantages and drawbacks. Don’t worry, all sites have them. It is important to explain to them so you know precisely what you are getting.
All non GamStop online casinos operating in the United Kingdom come with 3 impressive benefits that most players love and want to see as much as possible. They do make a difference and they can help you have a better gambling experience.
Casino companies without British exclusion scheme come with certain drawbacks. We were able to see a couple of these at any casino but the total outcome cannot be generalized. Anyway, try to see which drawbacks a casino has where you want to gamble.
It is important to add that all of these casinos must have a licence or two. A licence means that the casino is a safe and fair place to gamble and win. Non GamStop UK casinos for local players usually have just one licence. Available options are listed below.
Yes, this network affects online casinos and a lot of them. Keep in mind that this is an online system so it cannot be used for mortar casinos. GamStop doesn’t have anything to do with land-based casinos and your self-exclusion won’t be effective in that case scenario. The situation is the same with other networks of the same type.
Most if not all casinos that have the United Kingdom Gambling Commission licence are members of GamStop. This gambling authority provider makes sure that casinos accept GamStop in order to add a protection layer to their offerings and eliminate the risk of addiction. Casinos that do not have this licence are rarely members of the network or other blocking systems.
No, not all casinos use this network. When the self-exclusion scheme was approved by UKGC the majority of casino sites joined it. Despite this, we can see almost countless international gambling sites that are not members of the network. However, not all of them accept players from the United Kingdom. It is important to find a casino that will accept your account and where you have rights.
Yes, there are a few options to choose from. We have covered all of those alternatives above in our list. Your only task is to go back, check the best casinos and choose the one you want to visit. Keep in mind that all of them have an excellent selection of games and promos ready for you.
Yes, it is possible to get a self-exclusion feature at casinos that are not members of GamStop. You will need to contact their customer support and ask them to ban or block your account. This is a simple task that can be completed within minutes. You will need to do that for each casino.
There are a few casinos we would like to recommend in this case scenario. But, we chose Very Well Casino. This site offers amazing promotions, even better games, and all kinds of other perks you will want to check out and enjoy. It is a safe and extremely popular option for many gamblers in the UK.
The correct way is casinos not on GamStop and here is why. GamStop is a self-exclusion program for UK gamblers, while GameStop is a company that sells stuff for gamers. It is really confusing for many people as both these terms appeared approximately at one time.

Before you decide where you want to gamble, it would be a wise decision to take a look at the types we have discovered. Here are the types of British casino sites not blocked by GamStop:
Which games can you play at these casinos? There are plenty of games not on GamStop which is a nice thing. However, all of them can be categorized. These are different types of games that are very popular, appealing and they basically allow you to enjoy a type of game you like. At these casinos, you can play:

Software developers are something that can make a casino stunning, great or not so great. More brands mean more games and more options. Although there are countless variations in this case scenario, we were able to find the best ones. Here is the list of software developers and casinos exempt from GamStop:
We don’t believe in perfection. All UK-based casinos that are not on GamStop do come with a unique set of pros and cons. In other terms, these are advantages and drawbacks. Don’t worry, all sites have them. It is important to explain to them so you know precisely what you are getting.

Casino companies without British exclusion scheme come with certain drawbacks. We were able to see a couple of these at any casino but the total outcome cannot be generalized. Anyway, try to see which drawbacks a casino has where you want to gamble.
It is important to add that all of these casinos must have a licence or two. A licence means that the casino is a safe and fair place to gamble and win. Non GamStop UK casinos for local players usually have just one licence. Available options are listed below.
Yes, this network affects online casinos and a lot of them. Keep in mind that this is an online system so it cannot be used for mortar casinos. GamStop doesn’t have anything to do with land-based casinos and your self-exclusion won’t be effective in that case scenario. The situation is the same with other networks of the same type.
Most if not all casinos that have the United Kingdom Gambling Commission licence are members of GamStop. This gambling authority provider makes sure that casinos accept GamStop in order to add a protection layer to their offerings and eliminate the risk of addiction. Casinos that do not have this licence are rarely members of the network or other blocking systems.
No, not all casinos use this network. When the self-exclusion scheme was approved by UKGC the majority of casino sites joined it. Despite this, we can see almost countless international gambling sites that are not members of the network. However, not all of them accept players from the United Kingdom. It is important to find a casino that will accept your account and where you have rights.
Yes, there are a few options to choose from. We have covered all of those alternatives above in our list. Your only task is to go back, check the best casinos and choose the one you want to visit. Keep in mind that all of them have an excellent selection of games and promos ready for you.
Yes, it is possible to get a self-exclusion feature at casinos that are not members of GamStop. You will need to contact their customer support and ask them to ban or block your account. This is a simple task that can be completed within minutes. You will need to do that for each casino.
There are a few casinos we would like to recommend in this case scenario. But, we chose Very Well Casino. This site offers amazing promotions, even better games, and all kinds of other perks you will want to check out and enjoy. It is a safe and extremely popular option for many gamblers in the UK.
The correct way is casinos not on GamStop and here is why. GamStop is a self-exclusion program for UK gamblers, while GameStop is a company that sells stuff for gamers. It is really confusing for many people as both these terms appeared approximately at one time.

Casinos that do not have this licence are rarely members of the network or other blocking systems.
No, not all casinos use this network. When the self-exclusion scheme was approved by UKGC the majority of casino sites joined it. Despite this, we can see almost countless international gambling sites that are not members of the network. However, not all of them accept players from the United Kingdom. It is important to find a casino that will accept your account and where you have rights.
Yes, there are a few options to choose from. We have covered all of those alternatives above in our list. Your only task is to go back, check the best casinos and choose the one you want to visit. Keep in mind that all of them have an excellent selection of games and promos ready for you.
Yes, it is possible to get a self-exclusion feature at casinos that are not members of GamStop. You will need to contact their customer support and ask them to ban or block your account. This is a simple task that can be completed within minutes. You will need to do that for each casino.
There are a few casinos we would like to recommend in this case scenario. But, we chose Very Well Casino. This site offers amazing promotions, even better games, and all kinds of other perks you will want to check out and enjoy. It is a safe and extremely popular option for many gamblers in the UK.
The correct way is casinos not on GamStop and here is why. GamStop is a self-exclusion program for UK gamblers, while GameStop is a company that sells stuff for gamers. It is really confusing for many people as both these terms appeared approximately at one time.

All UK online casinos and bookmakers will be told to sign up to Gamstop, it is understood
A system that allows problem gamblers to block themselves from all UK betting websites in one go has finally been approved by the industry regulator, 18 months after it was supposed to be ready, the Guardian understands.
All gambling companies will be told to sign up to Gamstop, developed by the trade body for online casinos and bookmakers, as a condition of their licence to operate in the UK.
The Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry, is expected to announce the requirement as soon as this week, after satisfying itself that concerns about the scheme’s effectiveness have been dealt with.
Earlier investigations, including by the Guardian, revealed flaws in the self-exclusion scheme which allowed problem gamblers to bypass self-imposed blocks.
In May last year, five months after Gamstop’s unofficial launch, the commission warned the industry trade body, the Remote Gambling Association (RGA), of specific failings in the system.
The commission said it was concerned that Gamstop did not synchronise its list of registered users with companies’ promotional mailing lists. This meant that addicts who signed up in an effort to curb their habit might still be bombarded with direct marketing emails. Such promotional emails have been a common feature of several regulatory rulings against gambling companies including Sky Bet and LeoVegas.
In a letter obtained by the Guardian at the time, the commission’s executive director, Tim Miller, said he was “yet to see proper evidence of the effectiveness” of Gamstop. He told the RGA that it was “unacceptable that currently Gamstop does not interact with marketing lists in that way”.

Bookies withdraw new games after they are accused of trying to bypass laws cutting stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 a spin to £2. Rob Davies
Around 99% of gambling operators in the UK are understood to have committed themselves to using Gamstop already and those that do not will risk losing their licence to operate. Users of Gamstop, which is up and running but does not yet have the backing of the commission, are believed to number in their tens of thousands already.
The Gambling Commission declined to comment on whether it was on the verge of approving Gamstop. “We have nothing further to announce on this at the moment,” said a spokesperson.
Official approval of GamStop comes amid a broader push by campaigners, the Labour party and even the commission itself to tighten up regulation of online gambling, after curbs were imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in high street bookmakers.
Measures under discussion include a ban on betting with credit cards. Labour has called for legislation to replace the Gambling Act 2005, put in place by Tony Blair’s Labour government before an explosion of online casinos and bookmakers.

Hey, this is Paul Hayward, residing in the UK. I graduated from the University of Oxford in the year 2005. After my Master’s degree, I got a Doctorate in Economic Sciences. I had a grade point of A in my mandatory comprehensive examination papers of Microeconomics and Econometrics. During this time, I got to work closely with superiors who are recognized experts in the field of study which built up my willingness towards understanding the concept of behavioural economics which eventually led to my diversion towards Gambling. The Economics Ph.D. is designed to train a student to research and analyze high academic merit and to make important, benefiting contributions to the subject. The Department of Economics enjoys an international reputation which was also a reason behind my interest in this field. Doctoral researchers have quite a few important openings for jobs. Some may choose to become a part of the academics department or work with the Government, supranational organizations or in the research departments of major financial institutions. It is expected that they would achieve a decent and substantial understanding of the ongoing economic issues in the country enabling them to take a lead or a stand regarding the matter.
After completing my Doctorate in 2005, I was looking for various opportunities to pave my path for the future. It was about then when the UK released its first Gambling Act. It mostly revolved around online gambling in the UK. The major changes that the Gambling Act brought about were the transfer of licensing authority from Magistrate’s Court to UK authorities or licensing boards and the establishment of the UKGC. It was huge news back then and it was covered by all the leading news channels and other media platforms. Having completed my education in the UK, I was focused on pursuing my career in the economic system of the United Kingdom. I wanted to be a part of the economy in such a way that would have a direct link to the people and thus, it was the exact time when I decided to look into the UK Gambling Act that was predominantly ruling in the headlines during that time. I started studying Gambling, its pros, and cons, the significance of the industry, and all the details about the 2005 Act which eventually attracted all my attention. That was my initial step towards this career. I focused all my time on figuring out the importance of gambling in the UK, how the 2005 Act affected the punters, and what were the consequences of the Act. I realized that Gambling was a hugely lucrative industry, and it brought in major useful revenue for the Economy. It was also a leisure activity that all British people would take part in. I finally decided to be a part of the Gambling industry in the UK and its law aspects. It was not only about how it affected the economy but was also about how gamblers needed to figure out a safe yet controlled platform for Gambling.
After researching more about the Gambling Industry in the UK, I came across various facts that the Gambling Act of 2005 had determined:
Online Gambling was included in the Act due to the significant increase in the rise of gamblers. The companies whose operations are UK based could only get hold of licenses to operate in the UK by the Gambling Commission. As a resident of the UK, a gambler can gamble safely within legal rights and there is a wide range of sites where one is welcome. However, all UK online gambling sites have included the Gamstop policy which ensures that gambling is conducted in a fair way and it also protects gamblers from exploitation or addiction towards it. I felt that studying more about online gambling would be beneficial since it was well regulated in the UK and it only allowed sites that were approved by the commission. Also, there was the UKGC where one could turn in case of any unfairness while Gambling. Personally, I wanted to choose online gambling due to its diversity and accessibility to all types of gamblers from all over the globe.
The aim of UKGC was to keep any sort of crime out of Gambling in the UK. However, the concept of providing licenses to gambling sites for operating in the UK had a mixed outcome. While some punters were okay to register themselves agreeing to the Gamstop policy, many were sceptical since they were bound by a contract that could restrict their gameplay. Gambling is a leisure activity and imposing regulations like these made the gamblers choose internationally operated gambling sites over the ones that originated in the UK.
UKGC is preparing new regulations in the online casino forum that would solely focus on mobile casinos where the operators must verify the identification of the gamblers via KYC and AML checks. Also, no credit cards would be accepted as payment methods in online casinos in the UK. This has been proposed to avoid children below 18 indulge in gambling. This solution would actually help to control underage gambling problems because the gambling platforms would verify all the details and restrict payments via credit cards that would have some other name as on the account. Restricting credit card payments would also help problem gamblers to avoid making deposits via their credit cards and getting into tremendous debts.
Gamstop scheme is beneficial for addicted gamblers as it would control their log in durations and timings in order to help them come out of the addiction and would give them a self-exclusion period. However, gamblers who gamble during leisure hours for fun and entertainment suffer due to this scheme because it mandates them into taking a break from gambling for a period of time that is not needed for them. Thus, it compels them to look for independent license holder sites that operate internationally to avoid getting tied by self-exclusion schemes.
Well, all sorts of Casino games interest me. From the themed slots, progressive jackpots, card and table games along with the live dealer variants. Among all of them, I would personally go for Blackjack because it has the best odds of winning, with a house edge of just 1% in most casinos. Also, blackjack is played against only the dealer and not against hooded poker champions.
Never let the lack of experience with casinos demotivate your chance of a lovely gaming experience. Losing or winning is a part of the gameplay. While RTP (Return To Player) is a definitive indicator, yet don’t forget to refer to the guidelines and information regarding the game. Especially the T&C, wagering requirements, payment and withdrawal process, etc.
As gambling evolves and changes, the UKGC must also mould its regulations keeping in mind the recent trends of gambling. The implementation and enforcement of laws must be executed focusing on both regular gamblers and addicted gamblers so as to benefit both these types of punters.

We continue our list with Richy Fish. The online casino with good first deposit promotion is great for those of you who like to get bonus money to play with. One thing to note is that the minimum deposit requirement is a bit high. Apart from that, however, the promotion has no other drawbacks.
With the bonus money, you can test hundreds of fun games. This will help you stick to your budget and you will certainly improve your skills as a casino player.

​Koi Spins Casino is home to many fascinating casino offers that are perfect for high and low-rollers.

We will conclude our list by highlighting the excellence of the initial deposit slots site called Fancy Reels. The deal is, of course, available to anyone who has not yet deposited any money into their account. In order to cash out the winnings generated from this bonus, you have to complete every single requirement bound up with the offer.
The latter also applies to all other casino promotions available on Fancy Reels. Similar to the operator mentioned above, this one also organises many slot tournaments and lottery promotions.
We know that sometimes websites that are loved by others do not seem so good to you. If that’s the case with the platforms listed above, do not worry. We have prepared a few other sites with first time casino bonuses that are guaranteed to satisfy all your interests as a gambler. You can check them out in the list below:
All online gambling sites with casino registration offers have their specific characteristics. Some of them are typical of only one platform, while others are intrinsic to all such websites. In the next couple of paragraphs, we will list some of the common advantages and disadvantages of casinos with first deposit promos for newcomers.
As usual, we will begin by pointing out the positive aspects of sites that offer a casino bonus on 1st deposit available for newcomers. We are convinced that you will discover even more benefits when you explore the sites mentioned earlier.
If you happen to discover big first deposit bonus casino offers, this would mean that you will have enough bonus money to explore a big part of the gaming selection presented on the site. Many users take advantage of such bonuses for this purpose – to play as many games as possible without spending their money.
First-time deposit promotions give you a chance to test some of the latest slots on the market or games you are not familiar with at all. This can not only contribute to great potential wins, but it will also improve your skills as an online casino player.
If you have more money in your account, this automatically means that you have a higher chance of winning. After all, the more funds you own, the more you can play. This is one of the reasons why many users claim online casino bonus deals that grant them bonus money for playing on the site.
There are a few handicaps associated with operators offering online casino first deposit bonuses, and the most important ones are listed below. We encourage each one of you to carefully read the next lines, as they are quite important, especially for new players without previous experience.
Almost every casino bonus has a period during which all conditions must be fulfilled. If you happen to fail, you will lose all your winnings generated from the bonus. Unfortunately, sometimes these time periods are quite short.
Another thing you may find disappointing when it comes to casino registration offers is that there may be withdrawal limitations. For example, a customer may only be permitted to withdraw a specific amount of money after their first deposit, even if they have much more than that in their account.
Last but not least, certain first deposit bonus casino offers may come with incredibly arduous wagering requirements. Unquestionably, this is one of the most considerable potential drawbacks a deal may be associated with.
Most of you probably know that each casino bonus is for a specific group of games. Some are released exclusively for fans of slots, while others are preferred mostly by players of live dealer games. If you are interested in learning about the different options, take a look at the list below, which provides details on the best first deposit bonus casino games:
The process of claiming a first deposit online casino bonus is incredibly simple, and we’ll prove it with the next list. Below, you will find useful information that will help you take advantage of any promotion that catches your eye.
Every casino bonus available online has its peculiarities and requirements. Some offers may give you the opportunity to grab 100% of your deposit in the form of bonus money, while others may offer you a 400% deposit bonus.

Fortunately for all potential casino players, almost every gambling website features at least one welcome bonus for newbies. Depending on the brand, clients may be offered different benefits varying from free spins to bonus funds. Make sure you choose a deal whose requirements you agree with.
There are many 1st deposit casino bonus deals, but some of them are simply better than others. For example, if you see a 100% bonus and a 400% bonus with identical wagering requirements, which one will you choose? The 400% one surely does sound better, which is why it’s considered one of the best types of welcome bonuses available.
One of the casinos that feature the absolute best first deposit online casino bonus is Magic Win. The platform has an excellent interface, so you will have zero trouble finding the promotion and claiming it. What’s more, the offer will give you the chance to test some of the most famous slots accessible on the site.

Looking for a casino that offers a 300% bonus on the first payment? Well, you are in the right place as we have a list of the best sites offering 300% deposit bonus for UK players. Deposit bonuses are popular across all gambling sites regardless of the games offered, and you can claim anything from a small to a gigantic one.
Virtually all online casinos offer bonuses and promotions for their players. However, finding a 300 percent bonus package on casino games can be an overwhelming, time-consuming task. We have compiled a list of the best deals from trusted independent casinos in the UK. Find more about our criteria and how we rate casinos below.
Here are the most popular 300% casino bonus offers:
Contents
Not every bonus you come across is desirable. It is vital to review the terms and conditions before claiming when you get 300% casino bonus deals. We focus on eligible bets, wagering requirements, betting restrictions, maximum winning, contributing games, expiry and other crucial aspects that tie up the deal. Our team also examines the following:
There’s no single best casino for everyone, considering the varied needs of players. You should join platforms that suit your needs. Even so, top-rated sites have hallmarking attributes, such as valid license, certified practices, fair games, secure payments, reliable support, etc., that distinguish them from others. Here are the five best sites offering a 300% bonus on deposit:

This is one of the best online casinos with 300% first deposit bonus you’ll come across. New players on Scarab Wins can claim a lucrative 300% deposit match up to £1000 on your first payment to the casino. You’ll need a minimum deposit of £25, and the site hosts other deals, including cashback and crypto bonuses. Payment methods include VISA, MasterCard, Maestro, ecoPayz, Trustly, Zimpler, Paysafecard, Skrill, Neteller and many more. Note that the offer has a promo code and comes with a 40x wagering requirement.

Magic Win is a new casino site where you can get 300 percent deposit bonus or more. The welcome package offers a massive 800% bonus of up to £3000 spread across your first three independent deposits to the casino. The first, second and third deposits provide 200%, 250% and 350%, respectively, each with a maximum of £1000. The minimum deposit is £25, and each bonus comes with a 50x wagering requirement to be fulfilled within ten days of claiming.

Vegas Wild is another excellent choice when looking for the 300% casino bonus. Packaged within the signup bonus, this promotion offers 350% on all deposits of £30 and above. The bonus also comes with a 20x wagering requirement and 10x maximum withdrawal. Note that wagering applies to the deposit and bonus, so if you deposit £30, you must win a minimum of £2700 to withdraw. On the other hand, the maximum withdrawal is based solely on the deposit amount made.

Slots’N’Roll Casino was launched last year and it offers a lucrative welcome bonus featuring matches for the first, second and third deposits you send to the casino. The first deposit earns you a 300% match bonus up to £2500 with a 50x wagering requirement. The second and third deposits offer 150% and 200% bonuses up to £1500 and £1000, respectively. This adds up to a welcome package offering 650% up to £5000. The platform also features sports betting welcome bonus and other fantastic deals.

This is another great choice when looking for platforms with a 300% bonus offer. Nevada777 casino has a welcome bundle featuring 750% up to £3000, spread across the first three independent deposits. Players can claim 400%, 150% and 200% in the first, second and third deposits, respectively. Each bonus comes with a 50x wagering requirement to be completed within ten days. They also feature complimentary spins you can spend on games from specific providers. Make sure you claim the welcome bonus within 45 days of registration.
You’ll encounter many offers for a 300% bonus at a casino. We prefer providing a top-five list, but you aren’t restricted to any of the above choices. With more sites coming up, players will always have a wide range of options. The priority is to find reputable and secure casinos with the best 300% deals.
The 300% welcome bonus is precisely what the name suggests. It is designed for players making their first deposit with the casino. Most deals are awarded for the first independent deposit, while some are spread across the first couple of deposits. In simple terms, if you deposit £10, you’ll get £30 free.
300% bonus casinos offer lucrative deals that attract players from all regions. The free bonus presents the opportunity to play more casino games with the potential of winning real money prizes. Other benefits include:
Although the 300% deposit bonus casinos in our list have many merits as described above, they also come with various drawbacks worth noting before you join. Here are the main disadvantages:
Most casinos have promotions offering unique deposit bonuses. You can claim up to 500% or more. However, each has terms and conditions that specify how much you must deposit, maximum bonus, wagering, total winning and more. You should read the terms to determine if the bonus is suitable. Here are other promos similar to the 300% bonus on the first deposit:
A 300% casino bonus is a type of deposit bonus that matches the amount you send to the casino. In this case, you get 300% of the deposit you make so if you send £100, you’ll have a total of £400 (£100 + £300) to play with. Note that this bonus match on deposit comes with a maximum limit.
Yes. These bonuses are offered in offshore casinos that welcome players from the UK and several other regions with regulated gambling. UK players can join any casino they want, including those hosted outside the country. As such, you can claim the 300% bonuses on all casinos listed in our ranking without breaking any law.
Finding casino deposit bonuses is an effortless task that involves a few searches on Google. However, the search engine will offer hundreds of thousands of options, basically all sites offering 300% bonuses online. Sorting through the options can be daunting, so we recommend starting with top five or top ten lists like our guide.
No and Yes. Casinos offer the 300% bonus once to new players only, so you can’t claim multiple times on the same site. However, some casinos offer 300%, 200%, 400%, and 500% bonuses. Nothing stops you from signing up for new player accounts in multiple casinos that offer the 300% deposit bonus.
Deposit bonuses come with a minimum deposit eligible for the bonus. There’s no standard minimum deposit, so this largely depends on the casino and promotion. The casino may set a £20 limit for this year’s promotion and change it to £30 or £15 in the next promo. On most sites, it is set at £25.
Every 300% bonus is unique and comes with specific terms and conditions. Usually, the bonus has wagering requirements players must fulfil to withdraw whatever is won. Make sure you check the wagering and complete all requirements within the expiry dates provided. You should also determine the contributing games, qualifying bets and maximum conversion before claiming.

Claiming a 400% bonus at a casino isn’t novel. Many sites have lucrative deals for new members, some spread across up to ten deposits. We have provided a top-five list to help you get started with the best deals currently available. However, you aren’t limited to any top ten lists. The goal is to find trusted sites with top discounts.
The 400% casino bonus is awarded to new makers registering an account for the first time. In most cases, the bonus is spread across your first couple of deposits. However, you can claim a 400% bonus on the first deposit. It all depends on the casino and deal. Most bonuses also have a maximum bonus you can claim.
Players love bonuses and 400 percent casinos in the United Kingdom is quite an attractive deal. You get to play more games with a fair chance of winning. Here are more benefits:
A 400% deposit bonus might seem attractive, but not all are great. Some have steep wagering requirements and are tied to the deposit. Here are other drawbacks of playing on these sites.
Although you can find a 400% bonus on the first deposit, most promotions spread it across the first couple of deposits. You’ll find many welcome packages that feature different percentages for the first three to five deposits. Some even have something for the tenth deposit. Just ensure you read all terms before claiming. Here are other similar alternatives:
As the name suggests, this is a bonus match on deposit and is designed to welcome new members to a casino and encourage them to make their first deposit. New members get to claim up to 400 times their deposit. However, there’s a limit for the maximum amount you can claim and wagering limits to fulfil.
Yes. We have ranked the top five 400% deposit bonus casinos provided by reputable international brands and there are hundreds more. No law prevents UK players from joining online gambling sites, so you can play wherever you want. All the sites in our rating accept UK players including those registered on GamStop self-exclusion.
The easiest way to find 400% deposit casinos is through Google. It is the biggest search engine and hosts hundreds of thousands of gambling websites. However, sorting through all this can be a daunting task, so we recommend our guide or any other reputable top five or top ten list that features the best offers.
Yes and No. Casinos offer the 400% bonus to new members and it is only available once, so you won’t be able to claim multiple times on the same platform. However, you can join multiple casinos offering 400% deposit bonuses. This gives you the chance to claim the bonus an unlimited number of times.
There’s no standard minimum deposit for all deposit bonuses. Most platforms set it at £25 but it depends on the casino and the promotion. The bonus may also require different minimum deposits if it is spread across more than one transaction. As such, you should read the terms and conditions to determine the minimum eligible deposit.
Virtually all deposit bonuses come with wagering requirements to fulfil. Wagering refers to the total amount (or the number of times) you must win (or play) using the bonus to withdraw. Some may be as steep as 99x while others are as low as 10x. You can keep winnings once you meet all wagering requirements.

To ensure the smooth functioning of your application's back-end, we develop a comprehensive plan that outlines how its components will interact. After comprehending your needs, we pinpoint the key elements or sections that will form the basis of the application's back-end and pick appropriate technologies. Subsequently, we establish connections between the components and elucidate the data flow.
We offer a systematic and streamlined approach to storing, accessing, and overseeing data in your application. Our method involves carefully selecting the most suitable database system for your needs, SQL or NoSQL. We then design a schema tailored to your requirements, defining tables, fields, relationships, and constraints. After selecting the database system, we configure it and perform data seeding. It involves adding initial data to assist with testing and development. Rest assured that we will guide you through this process, ensuring your data is organized and managed effectively.
Our skilled engineers craft the necessary server and network resources for hosting scalable and cost-effective back-end components. We carefully choose a cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Next, we set up virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions to contain the back-end code. Finally, our team configures the necessary network settings, security groups, and firewall rules to manage the traffic to and from your back-end services effectively.
Automating the build, test, and deployment procedures through a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is beneficial to guarantee the code's quality and dependability. The first step in this process is to choose a version control system to manage the codebase. Following that, a CI server such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions should be configured to automate the building, testing, and code quality assurance processes. Automated deployment pipelines are established to ensure that only approved code changes are transitioned to the staging and production environments. Furthermore, rollback mechanisms are incorporated in the event of any deployment failures.
We specialize in crafting your back-end system's foundational business logic and functionality. Our team of experts develops robust APIs and meticulously documents their routes, controllers, and services to handle business logic efficiently. We also prioritize user authentication and authorization, implementing top-notch security features to maintain data integrity. Our team can seamlessly integrate your business logic with external services, including payment gateways and third-party APIs if necessary.
We can help your application take advantage of the services and features offered by external providers by integrating additional functionalities. Our expertise often involves collaborating with various service providers, including SendGrid, Auth0, Firebase, and Azure Services (such as Azure bus and security layer).
We take care of your back-end development needs from start to finish. Our team fully integrates the back end with UI components and client-side code, ensuring a seamless and efficient development process. Our services extend beyond the initial assistance - we also offer maintenance and scaling options to accommodate your changing requirements. You can trust us to deliver a tailored and dedicated approach to your back-end development requirements.
Let's break it down. Back-end development refers to the inner workings of a website or application. The technical components that support an application, such as servers, databases, application logic, and APIs, comprise the behind-the-scenes section of an application known as server-side development. This part is responsible for managing data, logic, and interactions that occur on the server. On the other hand, front-end development is all about the user interface. It involves UI/UX design and the view that the user directly interacts with, which is why it's often called client-side development. It includes user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and front-end technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Native applications for iOS or Android
Hybrid or cross-platform mobile apps.



Deciding to develop a native mobile app for your business, you need to understand that two different source codes need to be written for application maintenance – one for the Android mobile app and the other for the iOS. Developing a native app is a long process with a high scope of tasks, which is more expensive than cross-platform development even though it offers much higher performance and creates a custom user experience due to the app's flexibility.

It is harder to achieve as high performance with cross-platform applications, counting their optimization difficulties. Even the cross-platform applications are cheaper to develop since their operation process runs on a single source code regardless of the device's type and OS. 
In Chudovo, we always do everything to ensure the sustainable growth of our apps.Thus, we integrate a range of cutting-edge, unique features that deliver quality performance for both users and businesses.

Here are some of the features we've implemented while the app development process:
Cross-platform support
Flawless integration with social media
Time-tracking in real-time
Modern push notifications
Live chat support
Integration with ML (Machine Learning)
Map integration
Messaging within the app
Search Bar enhanced with filters
Integration with Payment Gateway
Multi-lingual app support

Chudovo’s custom approach to mobile apps grants to create apps accordant to the lives of your probable user base. Before we start developing an application, you answer the list of questions that helps to get a clear vision of the implemented idea in an MVP or a newly developed mobile app from scratch.
Acknowledging the limitations of cross-platform development, our developers create the UI/UX that will be similar to the native experience as much as technically possible. We develop clickable prototypes to experience the future app by bringing the layouts together with the creation of the style guides to introduce a solution where each button answers the definite request of a user.
Along with engineering your app, we set up the backends and implement APIs and integrations with different systems. In this phase, we elaborate on the architecture of the software aligning it with the initially requested design and features.
Before the app is released, we polish it with broad QA testing at every possible level. While we do that, we find and fix issues, and tweak the app’s functionality. A thorough QA phase saves your time and monetary resources diverting any probable issues that could lead to major malfunctions and therefore, loss of the audience’s loyalty.
After the app has been released, we don’t leave you alone, supporting you within the pathway of its further enhancements after the application’s proper deployment at the app stores. We provide you with open-ended enhancements and continuing support to implement the unfolded set of application functions.

Manufacturers can gain a competitive edge by combining production-line monitoring with sensors to detect an impending failure. The sensors can measure when output is affected. When alerted, manufacturers can inspect equipment or take it out of production for repairs, leading to lower operating costs, improved uptime, and better asset performance management.
The automotive industry can reap substantial benefits from IoT applications. Along with the advantages of incorporating IoT into production processes, sensors can detect potential breakdowns in cars on the road and provide drivers with details and advice. By gathering information through IoT-powered applications, car makers and suppliers can gain insight into how to keep cars running and owners informed.
IoT sensors can provide a range of advantages for transportation and logistics systems. By tracking weather conditions, vehicle availability, and driver availability, fleets of cars, trucks, ships, and trains can be rerouted accordingly. Furthermore, sensors can be used to monitor the track-and-trace and temperature of inventory, such as food, flowers, and pharmaceuticals, and alert when products are at risk due to significant temperature changes.
IoT applications allow retail businesses to manage stock better, enhance customer service, enhance supply chain operations, and lower operational expenses. For instance, smart shelves with weight sensors can collect RFID-based data and transmit it to the IoT platform to monitor inventory automatically and create alerts if items run low. Beacons can also offer customers tailored offers and promotions for a more engaging experience.
The public sector and service-related environments can benefit from the use of IoT. For instance, utilities owned by the government can use IoT-based applications to inform their customers of large and small outages, such as water, power, or sewer services. Additionally, IoT applications can collect data to help utilities identify the size of an outage and deploy resources for a faster recovery.
The healthcare industry can reap multiple advantages from utilizing IoT asset monitoring. Doctors, nurses, and orderlies can know the exact location of assets such as wheelchairs, thanks to IoT sensors attached to them. This way, the IoT asset-monitoring application can quickly locate the nearest wheelchair. Furthermore, this system can track many hospital items, from ensuring proper usage to a financial record of physical assets in each department.
IoT can be used to track physical assets and enhance worker safety. For workers in hazardous environments such as mines, oil and gas fields, and chemical and power plants, IoT sensors can alert them of an incident or quickly aid them in an emergency. Furthermore, IoT-enabled wearables can measure human health and environmental conditions, allowing people to comprehend their health and physicians better to monitor patients remotely.

Our approach to product development includes a discovery session that gathers comprehensive information about the potential product. We begin by exploring the subject idea and identifying the target audience's pain points. It helps us create a list of features to address those pain points through a CRM solution. Our system architects also identify potential bottlenecks and suggest the most suitable ways to fix them. They also offer a preferred technology stack for this type of project. This approach allows businesses to validate their idea before building a fully-fledged software product, reducing the risks associated with bespoke software development. 
Our primary focus is creating UI/UX designs that provide companies with a clear overview of their customers through a sound CRM system. To achieve this, we specify the CRM goals, system requirements, and primary features before our designers create wireframes. These wireframes are sketches without colors or logos that display the location of the elements on web pages and their interconnection. The wireframes are then transformed into clickable prototypes and tested on real users. Upon approval by the client, our UI/UX team begins working on the final UI design. 
Our company that develops CRM software upholds the principles of the Agile philosophy, which stresses active collaboration with customers and continuous product improvement. This approach enables us to deliver high-quality products faster while ensuring predictable costs and schedules for our customers.

Each sprint begins with task prioritization, followed by the development team building the predefined features. After functionality is completed, quality assurance engineers test it to ensure it works correctly and has no bugs. Only after fixing all bugs our development team releases the code to production.
After the development and testing of all features, the custom CRM solution is ready for production release, marking the process's most crucial and thrilling stage. At this point, end-users can finally access your digital product. Additionally, our software developers create release notes, including technical documentation outlining all fixed bugs and major/minor updates.
As your business grows, your CRM requirements will also change. To address these changes, our team of CRM developers can integrate new features into your system as per your specifications. In addition, we guarantee to resolve any system malfunctions or bugs that may emerge with time. Lastly, we offer to update or restructure your CRM solution if necessary. You can rely on us to provide comprehensive CRM solutions that cater to your evolving business needs.

As soon as the planning is complete, the development stage takes place. Here our fintech software developers build fintech apps tailored to their predefined business requirements. To keep customers updated, we provide them with daily reports on the project's progress. This way, clients can monitor the development process and make changes whenever needed.
Quality assurance engineers are in charge of user flow integrity. They perform record tests to minimize risks of missing components or broken features. If a task passes tests, QA engineers transfer it to the project manager; if not, they give the task back to the fintech engineers for further revision and fixing. Apart from that, our quality assurance services include clarifying requirements, bug tracking and reporting, and performance testing.
As soon as our fintech development team completes all version releases and gets approval from the customer, they prepare a public release. Our DevOps engineers ensure that the financial technology product is available to end users and works smoothly regardless of the platform or operating system. Additionally, they deploy the solution to the development and production environment, offer data schema analysis, and perform data migration.
Our work does not end after the product launch. We offer clients post-release fintech software support, maintenance, and continued custom financial software development services to ensure their products stay relevant. To be more specific, we release regular updates, optimize app performance, and fix urgent bugs. This way, we minimize risks of system crushes or downtimes, enhance data security, and ensure stable performance.

We carefully analyze customer requests to ensure the final results meet their needs and expectations. Gathering information about the application's use and maintenance goals allows us to understand the client's current needs and provide the best outcomes.
Creating a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is vital for application maintenance and support projects. The SLA outlines service expectations, responsibilities, timelines, and response times, ensuring both parties are aligned for project success and efficiency.
Our team identifies the most beneficial method of software upkeep based on requirements and budget. Developing a maintenance plan proposal and implementing a strategy ensures ongoing reliability, performance, and optimization of asset performance.
An IT landscape review assesses an organization's information technology environment, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. We conduct a pre-support audit and create a knowledge base tailored to your needs, optimizing technology assets and enhancing security and efficiency.
During this phase, our engineers share their technical expertise and knowledge with the customer. This builds trust, establishes understanding, and allows for smooth project progress. We encourage customer feedback and provide ongoing support.
Our engineers monitor and manage the application and its technical elements, performing regular checks, addressing issues, and conducting updates and maintenance to ensure optimal functioning. This phase keeps the project on track within the timeline and budget.
Ongoing software maintenance involves managing and sustaining software applications to ensure effective and secure operation aligned with business needs. We identify weak points, fix bugs, resolve technical issues, implement updates and new features, and provide general support. This ensures applications remain secure, reliable, and adaptable, maximizing software investments.
Our team will uncover bottlenecks, fix errors, and ensure the stability of your software solution.SLA Review: If your solution undergoes software modernization or significant changes, we will upgrade your SLA to align with the new conditions. We assess the feasibility, enforceability, and fairness of your previous agreement and suggest necessary changes. Regular SLA reviews and adjustments are conducted when you continuously engage our support and maintenance services.
Performance Monitoring and Solution Stabilization: Our skilled developers vigilantly monitor your solution to identify and address underlying issues before they become critical. We adhere to best DevOps practices to maintain and update your IT infrastructure, minimizing the risk of regress issues and ensuring seamless integration of new features and enhancements.

Security Patches and Fixes: Our experts go beyond code reviews and feature updates to keep your software secure and optimized. We monitor the reliability of the libraries your system relies on and promptly update legacy ones with high vulnerability rates. In cases where no available updates exist, our developers create custom security patches to protect your solution from potential vulnerabilities. This comprehensive approach ensures your software is well-maintained, dependable, and resilient against various types of attacks.

The need for dedicated development teams has emerged especially since it takes considerable time, effort, and resources to find the right talent across multiple verticals. 
The dedicated software development team acts as an extension of the client's internal engineering team. We can help you opening your own R&D center and in building your own branded team from scratch as well as can find the engineers as extenstion to the team. Each team includes dirrent professionals and the composition may be different. In general, team may include experts such as frontend and backend developers, software architects, project managers, business analysts, designers, QA engineers, security experts and other professionals when necessary. 
Even though an extended version of the core team at the organization, the dedicated teams are capable of functioning almost autonomously once the client shares the requirements. The dedicated team has every unit including administration, HR, product management, and even resources for infrastructure maintenance. Creation of dedicated teams not only saves the organization’s resources, but also brings about a big boost to the customer's company development.
Chudovo specializes on building dedicated development teams for the customers from all over the world. Most of the customers come from Europe and USA. Offshore development team centers help customers meet their software development needs, give the opportunity to deliver their products with an appropriate quality faster, to save money, to plan the expenses and to anticipate future directions of the company's development.

As a first step, you should recognize an issue that is stopping your business from further development. Try to answer the questions like: "What does my business need to reach the highest client satisfaction?" or "What is my business lacking to fully satisfy the market's rising needs?"
You can raise this question in a brainstorm with your permanent team members who have a deep inner understanding to close all the weak spots where your business fails.
As soon as you find out what your business is lacking, you can specify the needs of your business in a few various ways, all of which are important. Here are some of the particular questions that should be specified:
These are:
Do you want to augment your team with outsourced talents on a long-term or short-term basis?
What is your staff augmentation based upon? Is it based on the new product to launch, based on the skills, or rare high skills?
How many people do you need to augment your in-house team with?
Take a precise look at the IT staff augmentation market before you make a final decision on what outsourcing agency you would choose. Understand what you want from the staff augmentation agency and make these the decisive criteria for all your searches.
Don't fall for the trap of the lowest price tag. You should always keep in mind that you get exactly as much as you've paid for. The costs should be reasonable and just in the middle.
If you have such an opportunity, always review and check the skill set of your potential candidates on practical tasks. Moreover, even the strongest skill set obtained by a candidate would not come in handy for overall project success if your potential augmented team member would lack in soft skills to effectively collaborate with your in-house team. You don’t want to hire someone who doesn't fit in the current team as this would affect the entire project.
Sort out all the details of your future collaboration with your IT staff augmentation agency of choice.
You should never get a feeling that you are pushed to a decision or manipulated in any way. Be rational about your demands and be fully transparent when it comes to your needs.
When it is time to sign a contract with your new IT staff augmentation partner, work it out to the smallest details.

Aspiring small-to-medium-scale businesses are looking at the ultimate business and tech expansion opportunities by outsourcing software development. Outsourcing software development services the opportunities that save costs and speed up software delivery at the same time. 
Our skilled professionals, equipped with the necessary expertise, will join your in-house team and work directly under your supervision on the project. 
The Chudovo team will handle specific aspects of your project (e.g., back-end development, QA) and deliver regular progress reports. You have the freedom to choose your level of managerial involvement. 
We will establish the development process from scratch and take complete responsibility for project risks, including timelines, budget, and software quality. 
Your technical requirements and business goals will be thoroughly analyzed to offer you the most suitable resources to bring your tech dreams to life.
Before commencing your project, all tasks will be identified and evaluated in scope and complexity.
Waterfall or Agile? Scrum or Kanban? DevOps or FDD (Feature-Driven Development)? This crucial choice of software development management methodology is based on the scope, complexity, timescale, and budget underlying your project. A reliable provider will guide you in the most individually efficient direction.
One should never downplay the importance a project brief bears in shaping the overall project success. Based on clear, to-the-point specifications, specialists comprehend the specifics, efficiently plan out the workflow, and reliably implement exactly the solution you expect in the first place.
Before all else, make sure to have a clear understanding of what expertise your existing team lacks or what range of outsourced input your project requires (e.g., full project completion, partial participation, specific skills, etc.). On top of that, always check the reputation and go through a portfolio of the provider you are about to turn to.
Be prepared to collaborate via project management solutions like Jira, Asana, Trello, or others if you are looking to track and monitor any details of the outsourced workflow. Workflow documenting, calendar scheduling, and common messaging are other auxiliary processes that you should be involved with.
Thorough testing and Quality Assurance should never be downplayed or overlooked. A reliable provider must have both tasks listed as a separate service, source testing and QA professionals, and guarantee tools to thoroughly test and polish your project’s results.
We prioritize after-release support to ensure your solution functions optimally for your business's success and remains current.

Another precaution would be to also restrict your provider’s access to project-wise data and underlying servers. And feel free to clarify important questions concerning IP protection with the outsourcing provider so that you can strategically approach any future outsourcing agreements or partnerships.

In the Discovery Phase, an in-depth review of an organization's IT operation's physical, administrative, and technical controls are conducted to assess their effectiveness. This review gives businesses a comprehensive understanding of their IT operations, helping them make informed decisions about their security posture. 
Analyze the data collected to detect potential control weaknesses and risk exposure, providing a professional approach for businesses.
Provide a comprehensive report outlining the control gaps found and the risks associated, along with proposed solutions for improvement. This document is intended for business professionals and should be presented professionally.

An audit assesses a system, process, or organization to determine whether it functions as intended. To ensure the success of the auditing project, it is essential to identify clear objectives that align with the business's overall aims. Here are some examples of typical ERP auditing objectives: 
Carefully consider who in your organization would be best suited to audit the project and review the software concerning the critical objectives. Make sure to include a varied selection of disciplines, not limiting it to IT and engineering personnel, but also include those who regularly use the system and can provide a practical understanding of how it operates daily.
Auditors must flag issues for review and approval: establishing an uncomplicated, transparent system for presenting and assessing audit results is a must before beginning the project. Depending on the audit range, this may be just a standard Google sheet, yet for complete cooperation, transparency, and efficient audit direction, we suggest a Kanban-style process board.
Once you have established the location for logging system issues, you should outline the information to be recorded. It will vary depending on the audit, but typically the log should contain: a concise description of the issue, the potential risk if it's not resolved, the auditor who found the problem, and the date and time it was identified.
It is essential to order issues by seriousness once the audit is finished and assign basic improvement tasks to the relevant personnel. Investing the necessary time and resources into making the necessary improvements is essential for making the audit activity effective.

As a starting point of a digital transformation, you should have a clear vision of why you are doing it and why your business needs to become more digital. Make a list of the core reasons driving your desire for digital transformation. Is it to keep up with the competitors, improve your clients' experience, or manage the company's data more efficiently? Once you have a list of the reasons, you can plan your digital transformation and understand if they can be met.
To decide on the ultimate development pathway, you should realize where your company is currently. Review all the processes and systems you have at your disposal and estimate the effectiveness of their operation. If you are using digital technologies and tools, what are they, and are they working to their fullest potential? Study all your organization's functions, structure and working process.
You must be looking to deploy digital transformation because there are some blind and weak spots in your business or opportunities that are missing to make your business prosper. What are the blank spaces to be filled with cutting-edge technology? For example, are you using the data you gather in the company's operation to extract value from it? What makes the clients and leads engaged and retained after they appear to be your customers?
When you have cutting-edge technology in your pocket, you should revise what talents you have in-house to deploy it. Having even the most advanced above-and-beyond technologies makes no sense when you have no digital skills to steer them. What talents do you need to unfold the upcoming transformation, and do you have any in the company? Do you know how to upskill the current in-house employees so they can unwrap the new technologies to bring value to your business?
When you understand all the points mentioned above, such as the company's motivation, perspectives, resources, capabilities, gaps to be filled and the presence of the in-house talent to deploy the digital transformation, you can come up with a digital transformation strategy which you can rely upon in its course. After its creation, you could guide your business upon this roadmap which ultimately should be tied to KPIs and a capitalization plan.
A digital transformation strategy is something that should always stay the same. It would help if you were agile as the digital sphere is one of these, which changes quickly. Thus, you should always make room for change in case any factors which have been valid at the planning phase have changed. Agility is necessary when you are disposing of a transformation of such type, and your company should learn to adapt and change course if needed.
Since healthcare providers are constantly under pressure to improve how they deal with patients while reducing costs, digitizing health services implies significant changes for health personnel and the general population. The availability of the appropriate technology and rapid access to data bring more agility and efficiency to the processes.
In this way, healthcare professionals can spend more time treating patients and less on bureaucratic activities.
Automation tools, such as medical records, agendas and electronic prescriptions, also facilitate the routine of these professionals, bringing greater visibility and organization. This prevents delays, misses and errors and unnecessary access to patients information.
Insurance companies that are early adopters willing to embrace a digital transformation will reap several key benefits.
The first is cost competitiveness by leveraging a cloud-based platform and paying as you go instead of paying for software licenses and infrastructure maintenance. The second is increased speed to market, which allows companies to conceptualize and launch products more quickly, and therefore see a return on their ideas and investments sooner. The third is increased agility, which means consumers can purchase products through any channel without disruption, making the journey from research to purchase smoother.
A fourth crucial benefit is an ability to connect with various ecosystem partners. Consider life insurance linked to wellness incentives, where clients are incentivized to use gyms or health programs to stay well through discounts on their premiums. Using digital technologies, customer data, subject to data privacy laws, may be shared with partners within those programs to provide customer benefits. Such a program would be complex and cost prohibitive without a digital platform.
The retail sector is transforming the digital world, and the transformation is revolving around the customer, who is the axis of the actions carried out. In retail companies’ digital transformation, the correct use of data is imperative to success since, with accurate information about customers and the market, it will be easier for retail businesses to compete in the market.
The digital transformation of the retail sector is mainly influenced by changes in consumer behaviour and the way and time of the purchase process (connected consumers). In this sense, Retail-as-a-Service (RaaS) solutions show a new world of possibilities for small companies to boost their digital development. Developing RaaS models allows companies to flexibly manage traffic spikes in commercial campaigns and offer customized solutions.
Logistics has undoubtedly been one of the sectors that have changed the most over time, mainly in its role within companies and industries. The more strategic the sector became, the greater the need to digitize processes and automate functions and technological solutions for producing, controlling and analyzing information.
The first steps on this path were towards the digitization of processes, followed by the automation of non-strategic functions. Finally, we saw that the sector adopted technologies in other sectors, such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and robotics.
This improvement in service levels is only possible with deeper monitoring, management and analysis. This is precisely where the digital transformation in logistics becomes even more significant.
In general, the digital transformation in logistics is more than an increase in investment in tools, systems and technologies that allow the optimization of resources, integrating stages and sectors to generate more fluidity and efficiency.
The main goal of digital transformation in media and entertainment app development is the constant upgrade to meet customers’ rising expectations. It entails a higher focus on digital services and modernizing IT infrastructure and the provided services.
The digital transformation process in this sphere includes:
• The development of new 5G networks.
• Launching modern digital services based in the cloud.
• Using data analytics and artificial intelligence tools to improve the efficiency of operations and customer satisfaction by the provided service.
For example, CSPs (communication service providers) can benefit from AI and IoT technologies to analyze customer data and proactively anticipate and offer new services that satisfy their needs.
The galloping progress of the digital transformation of the Education sector is gaining more strength in the face of emerging realities.
The benefits of digital transformation in the educational sector are innumerable. The main one is that students become more self-sufficient by handling digital tools. In addition, they can use innovative methods in their way of learning.
The digital transformation allows understanding the needs of each student to be attended to in a personalized way. Students can explore concepts on their terms, not limited by the material covered in class, a physical location, or even the teacher’s schedule. Traditional classrooms also lack progress-tracking mechanisms; however, with the help of modern digital tools, this can be achieved.
Digital transformation enables easier collaboration between schools, teachers and students even though it requires continuous upgrading of skills to embrace fast-changing new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR).
Digital transformation in financial technologies means harnessing the potential of digital technology and tools in all business areas to improve operations constantly. It also assists in developing a new business culture so that everyone in the business is comfortable with
tools and processes and knows how to use them to continually bring a company closer to its customers, even as the business environment changes and customer expectations evolve. In other words, it is a continuous process driven by innovation, data and technology to keep up with high customer expectations.
Since healthcare providers are constantly under pressure to improve how they deal with patients while reducing costs, digitizing health services implies significant changes for health personnel and the general population. The availability of the appropriate technology and rapid access to data bring more agility and efficiency to the processes.
In this way, healthcare professionals can spend more time treating patients and less on bureaucratic activities.
Automation tools, such as medical records, agendas and electronic prescriptions, also facilitate the routine of these professionals, bringing greater visibility and organization. This prevents delays, misses and errors and unnecessary access to patients information.
Insurance companies that are early adopters willing to embrace a digital transformation will reap several key benefits.
The first is cost competitiveness by leveraging a cloud-based platform and paying as you go instead of paying for software licenses and infrastructure maintenance. The second is increased speed to market, which allows companies to conceptualize and launch products more quickly, and therefore see a return on their ideas and investments sooner. The third is increased agility, which means consumers can purchase products through any channel without disruption, making the journey from research to purchase smoother.
A fourth crucial benefit is an ability to connect with various ecosystem partners. Consider life insurance linked to wellness incentives, where clients are incentivized to use gyms or health programs to stay well through discounts on their premiums. Using digital technologies, customer data, subject to data privacy laws, may be shared with partners within those programs to provide customer benefits. Such a program would be complex and cost prohibitive without a digital platform.

The initial step of a DWH provider is to create a personalized data warehouse structure for its clients. This is done by analyzing their distinctive business needs, current data management tactics, data origins, and quality measures. After finalizing the framework and ensuring its ability to adapt to future requirements, the provider moves on to the implementation phase. It involves carefully selecting appropriate hardware, software, and procedures to complement the custom design.
Once the custom data warehouse has been configured, the provider amalgamates it with all current data sources, including the customer's transactional systems. Depending on the circumstances, the approach may involve utilizing cutting-edge pipeline technologies or customized code to guarantee secure data transmission to the warehouse. Additionally, certain providers interlace the warehouse with present analytical solutions for internal analytics.
After the data sources have been integrated, the information they contain is combined, purified, enhanced, and consistently evaluated to ensure its conformity with the core data model. The purified data is then transmitted to the customer's chosen cloud platform. However, certain providers also allow for hybrid approaches where some data is retained on the customer's premises while the rest is stored in the cloud.
After the warehouse is established, the provider manages the upkeep of data accuracy, addition and removal of sources, and periodic checks on performance and ETL correctness. The provider guarantees that all aspects of the service, including the data model and infrastructure, comply with privacy, security, and governance standards.
After the warehouse is activated, the service provider performs the duty of maintaining data quality, managing sources, verifying performance, and periodically ensuring the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process's accuracy.

How does the handyman search service work?
The digital platform is a suitable solution for craftsmen or companies looking for support from other craft businesses in Germany. The web portal for project-based cooperation covers all the topics related to craftsmanship. The creation of a platform for craftsmen is a big step in terms of digital transformation. Software solution empowers craft businesses with alternative ways of growth.
Software for craftsmen gives craft suppliers the ability to manage and allocate their resources rationally as well as to propose partners’ employees/services for an exact period. Also, firms can perform the search for specialists with corresponding industry skills, experience, and location in narrowly specialized areas according to the current needs of the organization. The developed craft business software simplifies the process of craftsman search, making it easier to find a fitting worker within the defined time and rate, etc. Additionally, it helps companies from the craft sector to get additional profit from the work of an employee, who currently has no internal tasks and can be involved in external activities.
In brief, the designed system has the following parts of functionality:
Companies module
This is a page, where craft suppliers fill in general information about their business. Generally speaking, the company owner defines the craft industries, in which his firm operates. He also adds additional information like the number of employees in an exact industry, addresses of company branches, contacts, organization’s brief description, which can also include the corporate logo. In addition, the company owner can manage his profile as well as add his avatar.
Сraft business software offers an extensive company search with different criteria. The more information the company profile has, the higher the probability of appearing in search results. So, users can execute searches by location, craft industries, employee skills & qualifications, and certifications. For example, a customer has a project in Hamburg where it is necessary to conduct wiring in new buildings. He can execute a search by Hamburg + electrical services industry and find in company search results possible cooperation partners. The customer can review detailed company profiles to decide if this is a good match for him and contact the craft supplier to discuss the details.
Projects module
Companies can post projects on this digital platform while looking for support from other craft businesses. So, they just need to add information about the work to be done and brief descriptions. Additionally, they can define an industry or several industries and point out the amount of craftsmen needed. For example, there is an order for painters to design, decorate, and paint the walls of an office center.
On the contrary, craft suppliers have also an option to search for assignments from other companies and apply for them. Accordingly, they propose their help through the realization of an exact task. For instance, the company is focused on repairing buildings and has staff employees with different skills. This firm finds the project from another company and the scope of work includes replacement of the roof on several houses. In this case, the craft supplier applies the project and proposes roofers with respective skills for cooperation.
Employees module
Software for craftsmen has an employee module. In the employee module, craft suppliers create their employee’s profiles. Сertainly, the company adds its craftsmen, defines their skills & qualifications, and levels, and selects scopes like refrigerant certificates, driver’s license etc. Indeed, the company may add as much information as it deems necessary. 
Notably, employee profiles appear in employee searches for other companies. If the firm is looking for a cooperation partner, it can execute a search by employee skills & qualifications & scopes. In case of a match, the search executor can get in touch regarding the profile of the interesting craftsmen with the company owner.
Surprisingly, the firm also has the option to clarify the availability of its employees in their profiles on this handyman services marketplace. This helps other craft businesses, who are searching for additional resources to select the cooperation partner taking into account time frames. For example, company A has an employee in the heating/climate industry with proficient qualifications in heat pump installation and this craftsman will be available for the new projects in 2 months. Company B also has a person with these qualifications, who is available in 1 week. In turn, the customer has an order to install the heat pump no later than 1 month. He will select company B for the cooperation since the company has a skilled employee with the necessary qualifications and availability that matches the customer’s requirements. Anyway, it all depends on the situation.
Another key point is that employee search is featured with the search agent. For instance, the customer might execute an employee search, but no results are found. In this case, he has an option to configure his search agent. As soon as matching search results appear in the system, customers will be informed about them through the letter on a daily or weekly basis. Hence, the customer doesn’t need to open a handyman search service to check out if there have already appeared available craftsmen with the required skills.
Membership & invoicing module
The first thing to remember, each company has access to some scope of functionality based on its membership. In general, software for craftsmen offers 3 types of memberships. One of them is free with limited functionality; two others – paid. Paid memberships give access to advanced functionality and additional benefits. Сraft business software has a view, where companies can review, manage their current memberships and order additional packages.
Messaging module
Surely, the handyman search service has a messaging module. This module enables message exchange between platform users. Also, users here receive contact requests from employees, company, and project searches.
Forum
The digital platform has a forum, where users have access to interesting articles and materials from craft industries related topics. Furthermore, they have an option to comment on the postings and communicate with other forum visitors. In addition, it is also possible to post your articles with topics that somehow correlate with the craft sector. 
Must be remembered that this forum has a special search field that enables easy search for the articles by an exact word or phrase. In general, all articles are placed in various industry categories. If, for example, the user wants to read news and innovations from the sanitary industry, he can just select this one and review all the postings.
Admin tool
Handyman search service has an admin tool. It is available only for the platform owner team. In this admin tool, the client reviews extensive information about the platform users. Admin tool for handyman services marketplace showcases the following information:

Companies. The list of registered companies includes basic information about the firms. F.e. date of registration, selected membership, etc. Admin can open the company and check its detailed view. This information includes the data about the company industry, a brief description, and so on. Also, on the company detailed page admin can use the company deletion option and remove the company from the system. In addition, administrators can edit the information in companies’ profiles. Admins do this action only in the case if there is a corresponding request from the company. 
User login statistics. This overview showcases the statistics about users’ visits to the handyman search portal.
Search statistic shows the most popular searches among the users.
Vouchers generator for marketing campaigns. Platform owners can generate voucher codes with platform registration discounts to encourage users to use the platform.

Axios é um cliente HTTP simples baseado em promessas para o navegador e para o node.js. 
    Axios fornece uma biblioteca simples de usar em um pacote pequeno com uma grande interface.
Cliente HTTP baseado em promessas para o navegador e Node.js
Axios é um cliente HTTP baseado-em-promessas para o node.js e para o navegador. É isomórfico  (= pode rodar no navegador e no node.js com a mesma base de código). No lado do servidor usa o código nativo do node.js - o modulo http, enquanto no lado do cliente (navegador) usa XMLHttpRequests.

We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.

            To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation.
          

        Official documentation for the axios HTTP library
      


The documentation page was built using inert static site generator. It works like this: Inside the root folder, there are some configuration, templates, styles, and, most importantly, in the posts folder, multiple markdown files containing the documentation.
To compile the documentation page, one must first install the inert CLI:
Now, open a terminal and run the following command:
Inert will convert the markdown files into HTML, insert them into the templates, compile the SCSS styles and write the output into the public directory.

使用axios的基本用例
为了在CommonJS中使用 require（） 导入时获得TypeScript类型推断（智能感知/自动完成），请使用以下方法：
发起一个 GET 请求
注意: 由于async/await 是ECMAScript 2017中的一部分，而且在IE和一些旧的浏览器中不支持，所以使用时务必要小心。
用Axios如何发起POST请求
发起一个 POST 请求
发起多个并发请求
将 HTML Form 转换成 JSON 进行请求
Axios API参考
可以向 axios 传递相关配置来创建请求
为了方便起见，已经为所有支持的请求方法提供了别名。
在使用别名方法时， url、method、data 这些属性都不必在配置中指定。

您可以使用自定义配置新建一个实例。
以下是可用的实例方法。指定的配置将与实例的配置合并。

这些是创建请求时可以用的配置选项。只有 url 是必需的。如果没有指定 method，请求将默认使用 GET 方法。

一个请求的响应包含以下信息。
当使用 then 时，您将接收如下响应:
当使用 catch，或者传递一个rejection callback作为 then 的第二个参数时，响应可以通过 error 对象被使用，正如在错误处理部分解释的那样。

您可以指定默认配置，它将作用于每个请求。
配置将会按优先级进行合并。它的顺序是：在lib/defaults.js中找到的库默认值，然后是实例的 defaults 属性，最后是请求的 config 参数。后面的优先级要高于前面的。下面有一个例子。

在请求或响应被 then 或 catch 处理前拦截它们。
如果你稍后需要移除拦截器，可以这样：
可以给自定义的 axios 实例添加拦截器。

使用 validateStatus 配置选项，可以自定义抛出错误的 HTTP code。
使用 toJSON 可以获取更多关于HTTP错误的信息。

从 v0.22.0 开始，Axios 支持以 fetch API 方式—— AbortController 取消请求：
您还可以使用 cancel token 取消一个请求。
Axios 的 cancel token API 是基于被撤销 cancelable promises proposal。
此 API 从 v0.22.0 开始已被弃用，不应在新项目中使用。
可以使用 CancelToken.source 工厂方法创建一个 cancel token ，如下所示：
也可以通过传递一个 executor 函数到 CancelToken 的构造函数来创建一个 cancel token：
注意: 可以使用同一个 cancel token 或 signal 取消多个请求。
在过渡期间，您可以使用这两种取消 API，即使是针对同一个请求：

默认情况下，axios将 JavaScript 对象序列化为 JSON 。 要以application/x-www-form-urlencoded格式发送数据，您可以使用以下选项之一。
在浏览器中，可以使用URLSearchParams API，如下所示：
请注意，不是所有的浏览器(参见 caniuse.com)都支持 URLSearchParams ，但是可以使用polyfill (确保 polyfill 全局环境)
或者, 您可以使用qs 库编码数据:
或者用另一种方式 (ES6),
在 node.js 中， 可以使用 querystring 模块，如下所示:
或者从'url module'中使用'URLSearchParams'，如下所示:
您也可以使用 qs 库。
如果需要对嵌套对象进行字符串化处理，则最好使用 qs 库，因为 querystring 方法在该用例中存在已知问题(https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665)。
在 node.js, 您可以使用 form-data 库，如下所示:
或者, 使用一个拦截器:
当请求头中的 content-type 是  application/x-www-form-urlencoded 时，Axios 将自动地将普通对象序列化成 urlencoded 的格式。
在浏览器和 node.js 环境中都适用：
服务器接收到的数据就像是这样：
如果您的服务器框架的请求体解析器（例如express.js的body-parser）支持嵌套对象解码，则其接收到的数据将与您提交的数据一样。
以下是一个express.js的服务器示例，它将会把接收到的数据作为响应返回：

Axios 会将传入数据序列化，因此使用 Axios 提供的 API 可以无需手动处理 FormData 的数据并实现一样的效果：
HTML 表单可以直接作为请求内容来进行传输。
由于 node.js 当前不支持从文件创建 Blob，因此您可以使用第三方软件包来实现该目的。
当 Axios 版本小于 v1.3.0 时您必须引入 form-data 包。
从 v0.27.0 版本开始，当请求头中的 Content-Type 是 multipart/form-data 时，Axios 支持自动地将普通对象序列化成一个 FormData 对象。
这个示例请求演示了如何将一个数据通过 FormData 格式进行提交（浏览器与 Node.js 环境）：
Axios FormData 序列化器支持一些特殊的结尾，以执行以下操作：
提示：默认情况下，展开、扩展操作将在数组和 FileList 对象上使用。
FormData 序列化器支持通过 config.formSerializer: object 这个参数来传递一些额外的选项，以支持一些特殊的情况：
假设说我们有一个这样的示例对象：
接下来这些序列化的步骤将会由 Axios 内置的序列化器自动执行：
Axios支持以下别名方法：postForm，putForm，patchForm，这些方法只是对应的 HTTP 方法，其 content-type 头部默认设为multipart/form-data。
FileList 对象可以被直接传递：
所有文件将使用相同的字段名files[]发送。
一些注意事项
在axios达到 1.0 版本之前，破坏性更改将以新的次要版本发布。 例如 0.5.1 和 0.5.4 将具有相同的 API，但 0.6.0 将具有重大变化。
axios 依赖原生的ES6 Promise实现而被支持。
如果你的环境不支持 ES6 Promise，你可以使用polyfill。
axios 包含 TypeScript 类型定义。
axios 深受Angular提供的$http service的启发。
最终，axios提供了一个独立的类似于 $http 的服务，以便在Angular之外使用。

Adhere to and help enforce the Code of Conduct. It is expected that you have read the code of conduct and that you agree to live by it. This community should be friendly and welcoming.
Triage issues. As a collaborator, you may help sort through the issues that are reported. Issues vary from bugs, regressions, feature requests, questions, etc. Apply the appropriate label(s) and respond as needed. If it is a legitimate request, please address it, otherwise feel free to close the issue and include a comment with a suggestion on where to find support. If an issue has been inactive for more than a week (i.e., the owner of the issue hasn’t responded to you), close the issue with a note indicating stale issues are closed; it can always be reopened if needed. In the case of issues that require a code change, encourage the owner to submit a PR. For less complex code changes, add a very simple and detailed checklist, apply the “first-timers-only” label, and encourage a newcomer to open source to get involved.
Answer questions. It is not expected that you provide answers to questions that aren’t relevant, nor do you need to mentor people on how to use JavaScript, etc. If the question is not directly about the module, please close the issue. If the question stems from poor documentation, please update the docs and consider adding a code example. In any event try to be helpful and remember that there’s no such thing as a stupid question.
Assist with PRs. By encouraging contributors to supply a PR for their own issue this is ideally where most of your attention will be focused. Keep a few things in mind as you review PRs.

为了让Axios被尽可能多的人所了解，将文档翻译成多种语言是必要的。我们对想要帮助翻译文档的人表示衷心的感谢。本文给出了向文档添加翻译的指南。
每种语言的翻译都由一个配置文件{language-shortcut}.lang.js（例如，en.lang.js或者de.lang.js），以及一些翻译后的文档文件组成posts/{language-shortcut}/*.md（例如posts/en或者posts/de）。{language-shortcut}应该用你所使用的语言的ISO 639-1双字母代号替换。
当你编写完了配置文件后，你需要在项目配置文件里注册该配置。你需要打开inert.config.js文件并且在接近顶部的位置添加下面这一行代码：
当然，别忘了将上面这行代码的{language-shortuct}部分替换成你所使用语言的ISO 369-1双字母代号。
现在，找到该文件的langs常量。如果该常量的声明在你的require语句之前，请将你的require语句移至该常量声明之前。对于langs列表，你需要添加如下这个对象：
现在，你可以开始翻译文档了。将posts/en文件夹复制到一个新文件夹posts/{language-shortcut}，翻译这个新文件夹下的所有文件（保持文件名不变，只翻译文件内容）。
如果你遇到了任何问题，欢迎前来提出问题。
We want to make this open-source project available for people all around the world.
Help to translate the content of this tutorial to your language!
Imagine that you’re a top singer, and fans ask day and night for your upcoming song.
To get some relief, you promise to send it to them when it’s published. You give your fans a list. They can fill in their email addresses, so that when the song becomes available, all subscribed parties instantly receive it. And even if something goes very wrong, say, a fire in the studio, so that you can’t publish the song, they will still be notified.
Everyone is happy: you, because the people don’t crowd you anymore, and fans, because they won’t miss the song.
This is a real-life analogy for things we often have in programming:
The analogy isn’t terribly accurate, because JavaScript promises are more complex than a simple subscription list: they have additional features and limitations. But it’s fine to begin with.
The constructor syntax for a promise object is:
The function passed to new Promise is called the executor. When new Promise is created, the executor runs automatically. It contains the producing code which should eventually produce the result. In terms of the analogy above: the executor is the “singer”.
Its arguments resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JavaScript itself. Our code is only inside the executor.
When the executor obtains the result, be it soon or late, doesn’t matter, it should call one of these callbacks:
So to summarize: the executor runs automatically and attempts to perform a job. When it is finished with the attempt, it calls resolve if it was successful or reject if there was an error.
The promise object returned by the new Promise constructor has these internal properties:
So the executor eventually moves promise to one of these states:
Later we’ll see how “fans” can subscribe to these changes.
Here’s an example of a promise constructor and a simple executor function with  “producing code” that takes time (via setTimeout):
We can see two things by running the code above:
The executor is called automatically and immediately (by new Promise).
The executor receives two arguments: resolve and reject. These functions are pre-defined by the JavaScript engine, so we don’t need to create them. We should only call one of them when ready.
After one second of “processing”, the executor calls resolve("done") to produce the result. This changes the state of the promise object:
That was an example of a successful job completion, a “fulfilled promise”.
And now an example of the executor rejecting the promise with an error:
The call to reject(...) moves the promise object to "rejected" state:
To summarize, the executor should perform a job (usually something that takes time) and then call resolve or reject to change the state of the corresponding promise object.
A promise that is either resolved or rejected is called “settled”, as opposed to an initially “pending” promise.
The executor should call only one resolve or one reject. Any state change is final.
All further calls of resolve and reject are ignored:
The idea is that a job done by the executor may have only one result or an error.
Also, resolve/reject expect only one argument (or none) and will ignore additional arguments.
In case something goes wrong, the executor should call reject. That can be done with any type of argument (just like resolve). But it is recommended to use Error objects (or objects that inherit from Error). The reasoning for that will soon become apparent.
In practice, an executor usually does something asynchronously and calls resolve/reject after some time, but it doesn’t have to. We also can call resolve or reject immediately, like this:
For instance, this might happen when we start to do a job but then see that everything has already been completed and cached.
That’s fine. We immediately have a resolved promise.
The properties state and result of the Promise object are internal. We can’t directly access them. We can use the methods .then/.catch/.finally for that. They are described below.
A Promise object serves as a link between the executor (the “producing code” or “singer”) and the consuming functions (the “fans”), which will receive the result or error. Consuming functions can be registered (subscribed) using the methods .then and .catch.
The most important, fundamental one is .then.
The syntax is:
The first argument of .then is a function that runs when the promise is resolved and receives the result.
The second argument of .then is a function that runs when the promise is rejected and receives the error.
For instance, here’s a reaction to a successfully resolved promise:
The first function was executed.
And in the case of a rejection, the second one:
If we’re interested only in successful completions, then we can provide only one function argument to .then:
If we’re interested only in errors, then we can use null as the first argument: .then(null, errorHandlingFunction). Or we can use .catch(errorHandlingFunction), which is exactly the same:
The call .catch(f) is a complete analog of .then(null, f), it’s just a shorthand.
Just like there’s a finally clause in a regular try {...} catch {...}, there’s finally in promises.
The call .finally(f) is similar to .then(f, f) in the sense that f runs always, when the promise is settled: be it resolve or reject.
The idea of finally is to set up a handler for performing cleanup/finalizing after the previous operations are complete.
E.g. stopping loading indicators, closing no longer needed connections, etc.
Think of it as a party finisher. No matter was a party good or bad, how many friends were in it, we still need (or at least should) do a cleanup after it.
The code may look like this:
Please note that finally(f) isn’t exactly an alias of then(f,f) though.
There are important differences:
A finally handler has no arguments. In finally we don’t know whether the promise is successful or not. That’s all right, as our task is usually to perform “general” finalizing procedures.
Please take a look at the example above: as you can see, the finally handler has no arguments, and the promise outcome is handled by the next handler.
A finally handler “passes through” the result or error to the next suitable handler.
For instance, here the result is passed through finally to then:
As you can see, the value returned by the first promise is passed through finally to the next then.
That’s very convenient, because finally is not meant to process a promise result. As said, it’s a place to do generic cleanup, no matter what the outcome was.
And here’s an example of an error, for us to see how it’s passed through finally to catch:
A finally handler also shouldn’t return anything. If it does, the returned value is silently ignored.
The only exception to this rule is when a finally handler throws an error. Then this error goes to the next handler, instead of any previous outcome.
To summarize:
These features are helpful and make things work just the right way if we use finally how it’s supposed to be used: for generic cleanup procedures.
If a promise is pending, .then/catch/finally handlers wait for its outcome.
Sometimes, it might be that a promise is already settled when we add a handler to it.
In such case, these handlers just run immediately:
Note that this makes promises more powerful than the real life “subscription list” scenario. If the singer has already released their song and then a person signs up on the subscription list, they probably won’t receive that song. Subscriptions in real life must be done prior to the event.
Promises are more flexible. We can add handlers any time: if the result is already there, they just execute.
Next, let’s see more practical examples of how promises can help us write asynchronous code.
We’ve got the loadScript function for loading a script from the previous chapter.
Here’s the callback-based variant, just to remind us of it:
Let’s rewrite it using Promises.
The new function loadScript will not require a callback. Instead, it will create and return a Promise object that resolves when the loading is complete. The outer code can add handlers (subscribing functions) to it using .then:
Usage:
We can immediately see a few benefits over the callback-based pattern:
So promises give us better code flow and flexibility. But there’s more. We’ll see that in the next chapters.
What’s the output of the code below?
The output is: 1.
The second call to resolve is ignored, because only the first call of reject/resolve is taken into account. Further calls are ignored.
The built-in function setTimeout uses callbacks. Create a promise-based alternative.
The function delay(ms) should return a promise. That promise should resolve after ms milliseconds, so that we can add .then to it, like this:
Please note that in this task resolve is called without arguments. We don’t return any value from delay, just ensure the delay.
Rewrite the showCircle function in the solution of the task Animated circle with callback so that it returns a promise instead of accepting a callback.
The new usage:
Take the solution of the task Animated circle with callback as the base.
Open the solution in a sandbox.

Javascript was traditionally the language of the web browser, performing computations directly on a user’s machine. This is referred to as “client-side” processing. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has become a compelling “server side” language as well, which was traditionally the domain of languages like Java, Python, and PHP.
In web development, an isomorphic application is one whose code (in this case, JavaScript) can run both in the server and the client. In this article, we will inspect how an isomorphic application processes requests depending on where the request comes from.
We are currently revamping the front end of Lullabot.com using Node.js (a runtime environment for server-side applications), React (an isomorphic JavaScript library built by Facebook), and CouchDB (a NoSQL database that has a REST API). These technologies will be the main actors in the following examples.
In an isomorphic application, the first request made by the web browser is processed by the server while subsequent requests are processed by the client. We will use the following article as an example:
 
When we inspect the source code (in Chrome, by hitting Ctrl + u) in the Network tab, we see HTML, CSS, and images:
 
And then, at the bottom of the source code, a few JavaScript files:
 
The asset /build/bundle.js is the React web application, which contains the list of routes, templates, and components required to navigate through the site. We will see further down how /build/bundle.js assumes command of the navigation through the website after the first request. Here is a step-by-step list of how this first request was processed:
Here is the trick: this same request is processed differently if instead of entering the article in the address bar and hitting Enter, we navigate to the list of articles and then click on the article’s link. Let’s try it out.
Now that we have the article (and the application) loaded in the browser, let’s navigate to the list of articles and click on the same article we accessed in the previous section. Here is the link to the article that we will click:
 
And here is the response viewed using Chrome’s Developer Tools to inspect the network activity. Notice the XHR requests at the log, which use the XMLHttpRequest object:
 
Here is how this request was processed:
The main difference between this request and the one in the previous section is that this time the request did not hit our Node.js application. This is fast, efficient and made my jaw drop the first time I saw it.
The following screenshot summarizes the above interactions by comparing them side by side:
 
Notice how the network activity log varies from one to another. For the one on the left, we entered https://www.lullabot.com/articles/importing-huge-databases-faster in the address field of our browser and hit Enter; while in the other instance we clicked on the article listed at https://www.lullabot.com/articles. The end result is identical for the user, but using the server-side method (which is the common way of doing things today) took 40x as long for the basic page load, as using client-side processing.
I have fallen in love with this kind of architecture. In the past, we would use AJAX and a bit of server-side code to make certain interactions with the page dynamic, but this always involved duplicating logic across both PHP and JavaScript. The most common example of this is a pager, where a direct request to ?page=2 is processed differently than a click on a pager link that takes you to page 2. Here is what we gain by building an isomorphic application:
There is a considerable learning curve when building an isomorphic application for the first time. In our case, when we rebuilt Lullabot.com, only Jeff Eaton and Sally Young were familiar with how isomorphic applications worked. The rest of us had to learn along the way and—while it was a mind-blowing experience—that can be frustrating as well.
Here are some of the challenges where I found myself banging my head against the wall:
I struggled to debug code as the first request runs in the server and the second in the client. For the former, I had to set up a Node.js debugger while for the later I had to learn how Browserify packs JavaScript files in order to use the web browser’s debugger plus the React Developer Tools Chrome extension.
We decided not to use JQuery as when React runs in the server there is no DOM to manipulate. For cases where we had to process Rich Text, we used Cheerio, a leaner alternative. This made me realize how dependent I was on JQuery when I struggled to write a POST request using XMLHttpRequest instead of $.post().
I had to be aware at all times whether the code that I was writing would run just in the server or also on the client because the client doesn't have access to the file system, which excludes many Node.js popular modules from being used.
Every module required via Browserify would end up being part of the web application (build/bundle.js). This meant that we had to be cautious about which modules to require client side. For example, I almost exposed our MailChimp API keys by mistake while writing the Newsletter component.
We had to manage two sets of settings: server side settings (such as API keys and other credentials) and client side settings (such as the hostname of CouchDB, ElasticSearch and other resources). Some of these settings vary in local, development and production environments and we were not sure of how to make it easy to manage that. We found a solution by mixing the envify and dotenv modules.
There are advantages and risks when writing isomorphic applications. The technology is certainly exciting and I encourage you to try any of the available isomorphic libraries and see where it fits best in your scenario. Then, feel free to post your thoughts in a comment below.
Thanks to Andrew Berry, Seth Brown and Sally Young for the feedback given while writing this article.

Eine POST-Anfrage ausführen:
Mehrere Anfragen gleichzeitig:

Anfragen können alternativ mit der Methode axios ausgeführt werden:
Für Komfort wurden Parallelbezeichnungen für jede gängige HTTP-Methode hinzugefügt.
Wenn die oben genannten 8 Methoden verwendet werden, können die Felder url, method und data im Parameter config ausgelassen werden.

Sie können eine neue Instanz mit eigener Konfiguration durch folgende Methode erstellen:
Die verfügbaren Instanzmethoden sind im folgenden aufgelistet. Die beim Aufruf dieser Methoden angegebene Konfiguration wird mit der Instanzkonfiguration zusammengeführt.

Dies sind die verfügbaren Konfigurationsoptionen für HTTP-Anfragen. Nur das Feld url wird benötigt. Für Anfragen wird standardmäßig die GET-Methode verwendet sofern die HTTP-Methode nicht explizit mit der Option method spezifiziert wird.

Die Antwort auf eine Anfrage enthält folgende Informationen:
Die Antwort wird so empfangen:
Bei der Verwendung von catch oder eines rejection callback als zweiter Parameter zu then, wird die Antwort durch das Objekt error verfügbar, wie im Abschnitt Errorverarbeitung erklärt wird.

Sie können Konfigurationsstandardwerte angeben, die bei jeder Anfrage verwendet werden.
Konfigurationswerte werden mit folgender Reihenfolge zusammengefügt: Zuerst die Standardwerte des Moduls (lib/defaults.js), dann die der Instanz und am Ende die der Anfrage. Jedes Element in der Reihenfolge überschreibt seinen Vorgänger. Hier sehen Sie ein Beispiel:

Sie können Anfragen oder Antworten vor ihrer Verarbeitung wie folgt abfangen:
Sie können einen Abfänger auch später wieder entfernen:
Abfänger können auch zu einer Axios-Instanz hinzugefügt werden:

Mit der Konfigurationsoption validateStatus können Sie die Statuscodes, die einen Error auslösen, festlegen
Mit toJSON erhalten sie ein Objekt mit mehr Informationen über den Fehler.

Anfragen können mit hilfe eines Cancel Tokens abgebrochen werden.
Diese API basiert auf den zurückgezogenen Vorschlag für abbrechbare Promises.
Ein CancelToken kann wie folgt erstellt werden:
Ein CancelToken kann auch wie folgt erstellt werden:
Info: Sie können mehrere Anfragen mit dem gleichen CancelToken abbrechen

Normalerweise serialisiert Axios JavaScript-Objekte zu JSON. Um Daten stattdessen im Format application/x-www-form-urlencoded zu senden, können Sie die folgenden Methoden verwenden:
In einem Browser können Sie die URLSearchParams-API wie folgt verwenden:
URLSearchParams wird nicht von allen Browsern unterstützt (siehe caniuse.com), aber es gibt einen Polyfill.
Als Alternative können Sie Daten mit dem Modul qs verarbeiten:
Oder auch so: (ES6)
In Node.js kann das Modul querystring verwendet werden:
oder URLSearchParams aus dem Modul url:
Das Modul qs funktioniert ebenso.
Falls Sie genestete Objekte senden müssen ist das Modul qs die bessere Wahl, da das Modul querystring bekanntlich Probleme mit solchen Fällen hat (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665).
In Node.js funktioniert auch das Modul form-data:
Alternativ können Sie auch einen Abfänger verwenden.

Bis Axios eine Version 1.0 erreicht, können Breaking Changes auch in Minor-Versionen stattfinden. Zum Beispiel sind 0.5.1 und 0.5.4 kompatibel, aber 0.6.0 moglicherweise nicht mehr.
Axios benötigt, dass die Promise-API unterstützt wird.
Falls ihre Umgebung dieser Voraussetzung nicht nachkommt, können Sie diesen Polyfill verwenden.
Axios beinhaltet TypeScript-Definitionen.
Axios wurde stark vom $http Service in Angular inspiriert. Das ultimative Ziel von Axios ist eine außerhalb von Angular verwendbare Version des $http Service zu erstellen.

Um Axios für so viele Menschen wie möglich verfügbar zu machen, ist es wichtig dass diese Dokumentation in möglichst vielen Sprachen verfügbar ist. Wir freuen uns immer über jeden der gerne eine Übersetzung beitragen würde. Hier finden Sie Instruktionen, die Ihnen zeigen, wie Sie eine neue Übersetzung hinzugügen können.
Jede Übersetzung besteht aus einer Konfigurationsdatei {language-shortcut}.lang.js (Also z.B. en.lang.js oder de.lang.js) und den übersetzten Textdateien im Ordner posts/{language-shortcut} (z.B. posts/en oder posts/de). {language-shortcut} sollte mit dem zweibuchstabigen ISO 639-1 ihrer Sprache ersetzt werden.
Seit neuestem müssen Sie die Links in der Sidebar nicht mehr ändern, da der Präfix nun automatisch eingefügt wird.
Wenn Sie mit dem vorherigen Schritt fertig sind, müssen Sie Ihre Konfigurationsdatei noch registrieren. Öffnen Sie dazu die Datei inert.config.js und fügen sie relativ weit oben folgende Zeile hinzu:
{language-shortcut} sollte natürlich mal wieder mit dem korrekten Kürzel ersetzt werden.
Suchen Sie nun nach der Konstante langs. Befindet sich diese Über Ihrem require-Befehl, muss dieser über die Konstante bewegt werden. Fügen Sie der Liste nun folgendes Objekt hinzu:
Nun können Sie beginnen die Dokumentation zu übersetzen. Kopieren Sie dazu den Ordner posts/en und nennen sie den neuen Ordner posts/{language-shortcut}. Dann übersetzen Sie alle Dateien in dem Ordner.
Falls Sie auf Probleme stoßen, können Sie jederzeit ein Issue erstellen.

A referência de API do Axios
Requisições podem ser feitas passando as configuraçãos relevantes para o axios.
Por conveniência, foram fornecidos pseudônimos para todos os métodos de solicitação suportados.
Ao usar os pseudônimo dos métodos, as propriedades url, method e data não precisam ser especificadas na configuração.

Você pode criar uma nova instância do axios com uma configuração customizada.
Os métodos de instâncias disponiveis estão listadas abaixo. A configuração especificada será mesclada com a configuração da instância.

Estas são as configurações opcionais disponíveis para fazer uma requisição. Apenas a url é obrigatória. Requisições serão setadas como padrão para GET se nenhum method for especificado.

A resposta para uma requisição contêm as seguintes informações.
Ao usar o then, você receberá a resposta da seguinte forma:
Ao usar catch, ou passar uma rejection callback como segundo parâmetro do then, a resposta estará disponível através do objeto error coomo explicado na seção de manipulação de erros.

Você pode especificar configurações padrões que será aplicar em todas as requisições.
As configurações serão mescladas pela ordem de precedente. A ordem é o padrão da biblioteca encontrados em lib/defaults.js, depos as propriedades defaults da instância, e finalmente config argumentos para a requisição. O último terá precedência sobre o primeiro. Aqui está um exemplo.

Você pode interceptar requisições ou respostas antes de serem manipuladas pelo then ou catch.
Se você precisar remover um interceptador mais tarde, você pode.
Você pode adicionar interceptadores em uma instância customizada do axios.

Usando a configuração opcional validadeStatus, você pode definir o(s) código(s) HTTP que devem lançar um erro
Usando o toJSON você pode receber um objeto com mais informações sobre o erro HTTP.

A partir da v0.22.0, o Axios oferece suporte ao AbortController para cancelar requisições em forma de API fetch.
Você pode cancelar uma requisição usando um cancel token.
O token de cancelamento do axios é baseado em retirada proposta de promessas canceláveis.
Você pode criar um token de cancelamento usando o CancelToken.source conforme mostrado abaixo:
Você também poder criar um token de cancelamento passando uma função executora para o construtor de CancelToken
Nota: você pode cancelar multiplas requisições com o mesmo token de cancelamento.

Por padrão o axios serializa os objetos do JavaScript para JSON. Para enviar os dados no formato application/x-www-form-urlencoded, você pode usar uma das seguintes opções.
Em um navegador, você pode usar a API URLSearchParams da seguinte forma:
Note que URLSearchParams não é suportado por todos os navegadores (veja caniuse.com), mas existe um polyfill disponível (certifique-se de preencher o polyfill do ambiente global)
Outra alternativa é utilizar a biblioteca qs:
Ou de outra forma (ES6),
No node.js, você pode usar o modulo querystring da seguinte forma:
ou 'URLSearchParams' do 'url module' assim:
Você também pode utilizar a biblioteca qs
A biblioteca qs é preferível se você precisar restringir objetos aninhados, pois o método querystring tem problemas conhecidos como este caso de uso (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665)
No node.js, você pode usar a biblioteca form-data da seguinte forma:
Alternativamente, use um interceptador:
Mais algumas notas para encerrar
Até que o axios atinja a versão 1.0, grandes mudanças serão lanças em uma versão menor. Como por exemplo 0.5.1 e 0.5.4 terão a mesma API, mas a versão 0.6.0 terá grandes mudanças.
O axios depende da implementação nativa do ES6 para ser suportado.
Se o seu ambiente não suporta o ES6 Promises, você pode utilizar o polyfill.
O axios inclue definições para oTypeScript
Axios é profundamente inspirado no $http service fornecido no Angular. Por último, axios é um serviço independente de tipo $ http para uso fora do Angular.

Para tornar os Axios acessíveis ao maior número de pessoas possível, é extremamente importante que estes documentos possam ser lidos em todos idiomas. Nós apreciamos qualquer pessoa que queria ajudar na tradução dos documentos. Este guia fornece instruções de como adicionar uma nova tradução nesta documentação.
Toda tradução é composta por um arquivo de configuração, {language-shortcut}.lang.js (por exemplo, en.lang.js ou ptBR.lang.js) e os arquvios traduzidos em posts/{language-shortcut}/*.md (exemplo posts/en ou posts/ptBR). {language-shortcut} deve ser substituído pelo código de duas letras ISO 639-1 do seu idioma.
Uma vez que tiver terminado a configuração do seu idioma e a tradução das frases e links no arquivo de configuração, você precisará registrar no arquivo raiz de configuração. Para fazer isso, abra inert.config.js e adicione a seguinte linha perto do começo do arquivo:
E claro, lembre-se de substituir {language-shortcut} com o valor código correto do ISO 369-1 (no nome da variável também).
Agora procure pela constante langs. Se a constante estiver localizada antes do seu require, mova o seu require acima dele. Na lista de langs, adicione o seguinte objeto:
Agora você pode começa a traduzir os arquivos, copie a pasta posts/en em uma nova pasta posts/{language-shortcut} e traduza todos os arquivos. (não traduza o nome dos arquivos, é claro).
Caso você tenha algum problema durante o percurso de tradução, sinta-se livre em criar uma issue.

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.

The response for a request contains the following information.
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.

You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults/index.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.

You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.

Using the validateStatus config option, you can define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.
Using toJSON you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.

Setting the timeout property in an axios call handles response related timeouts.
In some cases (e.g. network connection becomes unavailable) an axios call would benefit from cancelling the connection early. Without cancellation, the axios call can hang until the parent code/stack times out (might be a few minutes in a server-side applications).
To terminate an axios call you can use following methods:
Combining timeout and cancellation method (e.g. signal) should cover response related timeouts AND connection related timeouts.
Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:
Example with a timeout using latest AbortSignal.timeout() API [nodejs 17.3+]:
Example with a timeout helper function:
You can also cancel a request using a CancelToken.
The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancelable promises proposal.
This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects
You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token / signal.
During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:

By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use one of the following approaches.
In a browser, you can use the URLSearchParams API as follows:
Note that URLSearchParams is not supported by all browsers (see caniuse.com), but there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).
Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
Or in another way (ES6),
In node.js, you can use the querystring module as follows:
or 'URLSearchParams' from 'url module' as follows:
You can also use the qs library.
Note: The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665).
Axios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
This works both in the browser and in node.js:
The server will handle it as
If your server framework's request body parser (like body-parser of express.js) supports nested objects decoding,
you will automatically receive the same server object that you submitted.
Echo server example (express.js) :

The same result can be achieved using the internal Axios serializer and corresponding shorthand method:
HTML form can be passes directly as a request payload
Since node.js does not currently support creating a Blob from a file, you can use a third-party package for this purpose.
For Axios older than v1.3.0 you must import form-data package.
Starting from v0.27.0, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData
object if the request Content-Type header is set to multipart/form-data.
The following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):
Axios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:
NOTE:
unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects
FormData serializer supports additional options via config.formSerializer: object property to handle rare cases:
visitor: Function - user-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object
to a FormData object by following custom rules.
dots: boolean = false - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;
metaTokens: boolean = true - add the special ending (e.g user{}: '{"name": "John"}') in the FormData key.
The back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.
indexes: null|false|true = false - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of flat array-like objects
Let's say we have an object like this one:
The following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:
Axios supports the following shortcut methods: postForm, putForm, patchForm
which are just the corresponding http methods with the content-type header preset to multipart/form-data.
FileList object can be passed directly:
All files will be sent with the same field names: files[];
A couple more notes to round it off
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
axios includes TypeScript definitions.
axios is heavily inspired by the $http service provided in Angular. Ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone $http-like service for use outside of Angular.

To make Axios accessible to as many people as possible, it is important that these docs can be read in all languages. We always appreciate anyone who wants
to help translate the documentation. This guide provides instructions for adding a translation to this documentation.
Every translation is composed of a configuration file, {language-shortcut}.lang.js (for example, en.lang.js or de.lang.js) and the translated documentation files in posts/{language-shortcut}/*.md (for example posts/en or posts/de). {language-shortcut} should be replaced with your language's ISO 639-1 two-letter code.
Once you've finished configuring your language and translating the phrases and links in the configuration file, you'll need to register it in the root configuration. To do this, open inert.config.js and add the following line near the top:
Of course, remember to replace {language-shortuct} with the correct ISO 369-1 code (in the variable name, too!).
Now, look for the langs constant. If this constant is located above your require statement, move your require statement above it. To the langs list, add the following object:
Now, you can begin translating the files. Copy the folder posts/en into a new folder posts/{language-shortcut} and translate all the files (don't translate the filenames, of course).
If you hit any problems, feel free to create and issue.
